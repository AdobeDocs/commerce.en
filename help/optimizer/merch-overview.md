Create personalized experiences for your shoppers through product discovery and recommendations.

- **Product Discovery** - Enhances your site search functionality, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopper experience that maximizes conversion rates. It enables merchandisers to ensure that shoppers get the right products at the right time.  
- **Recommendations** - Uses artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms to perform a deep analysis of aggregated visitor data. This data, when combined with your catalog, results in a highly engaging, relevant, and personalized experience. Recommendations are surfaced on the storefront as units with labels, such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed". You can create, manage, and deploy recommendations directly from [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer].
