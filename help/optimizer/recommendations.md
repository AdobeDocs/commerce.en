Recommendations use artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms to perform a deep analysis of aggregated visitor data. This data, when combined with your catalog, results in a highly engaging, relevant, and personalized experience. Recommendations are surfaced on the storefront as units with labels, such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed". You can create, manage, and deploy recommendations directly from [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer].
