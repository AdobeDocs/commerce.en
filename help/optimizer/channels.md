Channels help you define your retail structure into meaningful business groups. A channel affects product visibility by applying specific policies and filters that determine which products are displayed on a storefront. These policies can include attributes like brand, model, or part category, ensuring that only relevant products are visible to shoppers based on the channel's configuration. Additionally, channels can use price books to display customer-specific pricing, further tailoring the shopping experience.

## Add channel

In this section, you create a new channel. Make sure you have already [created a policy](./policies.md) before you create a channel.

1. On the left menu, open the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** section and click on **[!UICONTROL Channels]**. ​

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add Channel]** button. ​

1. Fill in Channel Details:

    1. **Name**: Enter the name of the channel. For example, "Celport". ​
    1. **Scopes**: Add the scope (locale). For example, "en-US". Press the **enter** key.
    1. **Policies**: Use the drop-down to select the relevant policies. For example, "Brand," "Model". ​Make sure you have already [created a policy](./policies.md).

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button to create the channel. ​

    If the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button is not active, ensure the scope is properly added by pressing the **enter** key. ​

1. Once created, the channel will appear in the list of channels. ​

By following these steps, the new channel will be configured to display products and pricing based on the selected policies and scopes.
