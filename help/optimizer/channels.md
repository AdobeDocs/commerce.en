Channels help you define your retail structure into meaningful business groups. A channel affects product visibility by applying specific policies and filters that determine which products are displayed on a storefront. These policies can include attributes like brand, model, or part category, ensuring that only relevant products are visible to shoppers based on the channel configuration. Additionally, channels can use price books to display customer-specific pricing, further tailoring the shopping experience.

## Add channel

In this section, you create a channel. Ensure that you have already [created a policy](./policies.md) before proceeding to create a channel.

1. On the left menu, open the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** section and click **[!UICONTROL Channels]**.
