# Catalog layer

Catalog layers (also called catalog overlays) allow you to modify product data without changing the original source data. Layers apply changes to specific product attributes, such as name, description, images, links, and metadata, by creating a layer on top of your base catalog. Your original product data remains intact, allowing you to safely customize products and revert changes at any time.

## How catalog layers work

When a customer views your storefront, the system combines your base catalog data with active catalog layers to display the final product information. Here's how the process works:

1. **Layer application**—When a request is made with a channel ID and environment ID, the store service retrieves the relevant catalog view.

1. **Data merging**—The system applies catalog layers to product data based on layer priority order.

1. **Field handling**—Different field types are processed differently:
   
   - **Override fields**—Text fields like name, description, and meta titles are replaced by the layer value (higher-priority layer wins).
   - **Merge fields**—Array fields like images, links, and attributes are combined from multiple layers, providing a unified response.

1. **Priority resolution**—The order field determines which layer takes precedence. Lower order numbers have higher priority when multiple layers modify the same field (order 1 is the highest priority).

## Catalog layer use cases

Catalog layers are commonly used for:

- **SEO optimization**—Override product meta titles and descriptions based on AI recommendations from [Sites Optimizer](../manage-results/opportunities.md).
- **Seasonal campaigns**—Temporarily update product names, descriptions, or images for promotions without changing source data.
- **Regional customization**—Display different product information based on geographic location or language.
- **A/B testing**—Test different product presentations to optimize conversion rates.
- **Multi-brand management**—Customize product attributes for different brand catalog views.

## Add a catalog layer via data ingestion

You can add catalog layers to your products during the data ingestion process. This method is ideal for bulk operations or automated workflows.

**Prerequisites:**

- API credentials with permission to access the data ingestion service
- Product SKUs that already exist in your base catalog

**Steps:**

1. Prepare your layer data in the required format with the product attributes you want to modify.

1. Use the Product Layers API endpoint to ingest the layer data.

1. Verify the layer was successfully ingested by checking the catalog view configuration.

For detailed API specifications and payload examples, see [Product Layers](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/reference/rest/#tag/Product-Layers) in the developer documentation.

## Add a catalog layer manually in the UI

The catalog view UI allows you to manually create and manage layers, which is particularly useful for integrations like Sites Optimizer that generate AI-powered recommendations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a Sites Optimizer layer does not exist in your catalog view, the auto-fix feature in Sites Optimizer automatically creates one and assigns it order 1 (highest priority). If you delete this layer, it will be recreated the next time the auto-fix feature in Sites Optimizer runs and will shift existing layers to lower order numbers. If the Sites Optimizer layer already exists at a different order number, the auto-fix feature will not change its priority.

>[!TIP]
>
>For bulk layer operations, use the data ingestion API method [described above](#add-a-catalog-layer-via-data-ingestion).

**To create a manual layer:**

1. Navigate to **Store setup** > **Catalog views**.

1. Select the catalog view where you want to apply the layer.

1. In the catalog layers section, click **Add catalog layer**.

1. Configure the layer properties: (!!! THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED!!!)
   
   - **Layer name**—Enter a descriptive name to identify the layer purpose.
   - **Products**—Select the products to which this layer applies.
   - **Attributes**—Choose which product attributes to modify (name, description, images, meta tags, etc.).
   - **Values**—Enter the new values for each selected attribute.

1. Click **Save** to create the layer.

The new layer is added to the catalog view and is automatically assigned the next available order number.

## Preview layer effects

(!!! THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED--WILL PREVIEW BE AVAILABLE DEC 10TH!!!)

Before activating layers or changing priorities, you can preview how they affect product data.

**To preview layer changes:**

1. Navigate to **Store setup** > **Catalog views**.

1. Select the catalog view with the layers you want to preview.

1. In the catalog layers section, select a specific product or use the preview function.

1. Review the combined product data showing how layers modify the base catalog values.

1. Make adjustments to layer content or priority order as needed.

## Activate or deactivate layers

You can enable or disable catalog layers without deleting them, allowing you to control when specific customizations are applied.

**To activate or deactivate a layer:**

1. Navigate to **Store setup** > **Catalog views**.

1. Select the catalog view containing the layer.

1. In the catalog layers section, locate the layer you want to toggle.

1. Click the activation toggle to enable or disable the layer.

   - **Active**—The layer is applied to product data.
   - **Inactive**—The layer is preserved but not applied to product data.

1. The change takes effect immediately on your storefront.

## Manage layer priorities

The order in which layers are applied determines which values appear on your storefront when multiple layers modify the same product attribute. Managing priorities ensures the correct data is displayed.

**Understanding priority order:**

- Each layer is assigned an order number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Order 1 has the highest priority and overrides all other layers
- When multiple layers modify the same field, the layer with the lower order number takes precedence
- Priority only applies to override fields (name, description, meta tags)
- Merge fields (images, links, attributes) combine data from all layers

**To reorder layer priorities:**

1. Navigate to **Store setup** > **Catalog views**.

1. Select the catalog view containing the layers you want to reorder.

1. In the catalog layers section, locate the layer you want to move.

1. Drag and drop the layer to change its position, or use the reorder controls.

1. The system automatically updates order numbers based on the new sequence.

1. Click **Save** to apply the new priority order.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Changes to layer priority take effect immediately and may impact what customers see on your storefront. Review the preview before saving to ensure the correct values are applied.

## Best practices

Follow these recommendations when working with catalog layers:

- **Use descriptive names**—Name layers clearly to indicate their purpose (e.g., "Holiday 2024 Campaign" or "SEO Optimization - Product Pages").

- **Limit layers**—While the system supports multiple layers, using too many can impact performance. Consolidate layers when possible.

- **Test before activating**—Always preview layer effects before activating them on your live storefront.

- **Document priority logic**—Keep track of which layers should take precedence to avoid unintended overrides.

- **Review Sites Optimizer layers**—When using auto-fix from Sites Optimizer, the system creates layers at the highest priority. Be mindful when adding manual layers that might override AI recommendations. Learn more about using [Sites Optimizer](../manage-results/opportunities.md).

- **Monitor performance**—If you notice slow product page loads, review your layer configuration and consider consolidating layers.
