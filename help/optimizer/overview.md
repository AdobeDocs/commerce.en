The following diagram provides a high-level view of the Adobe Commerce Optimizer architecture.

- **Third-party catalog ingestion** - Ingest catalog data from any third-party source (PIM, ERP, and so on). Your catalog data is directly ingested into the merchandising services layer, which is a SaaS component called Composable catalog data model (CCDM).
- **Composable catalog data model (CCDM)** - CCDM is the foundational piece of Commerce Optimizer. CCDM is a highly scalable, flexible catalog data model which unlocks multi-brand, multi-business unit, and multi-language use cases. CCDM provides building blocks that merchants can use to create and manage catalogs at scale. Within Commerce Optimizer, you can manage your catalog by creating channels, policies, and locales that best define your business goals. In addition, the merchandiser can provide personalized experiences to drive traffic and engagement using product discovery​, product recommendations​, and intelligent merchandising. Learn more about [CCDM](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-data-model/overview).
- **Success metrics** - Provides real-time insights into the performance of your commerce initiatives. You can view before and after results of specific KPIs and evaluate the impact of changes and optimize for better results.
- **Third-party cart and checkout** - Like the catalog ingestion, you can use any third party system to manage your cart and checkout lifecycle.
