# Merchandising

In this section you learn how to create personalized experiences for your shoppers through product discovery and recommendations.

## Product discovery

Product discovery enhances your site search functionality, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopper experience that maximizes conversion rates. It enables merchandisers to ensure that shoppers get the right products at the right time. 

With product discovery, you set up facets, rules, and synonyms to:

- Create meaningful search experiences to help shoppers and buyers find what they want with as little effort as possible.
- Take advantage of AI-powered dynamic faceting and re-ranking of search results in response to in-session shopper behaviors.

## Recommendations

Recommendations use artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms to perform a deep analysis of aggregated visitor data. This data, when combined with your catalog, results in a highly engaging, relevant, and personalized experience. Recommendations are surfaced on the storefront as units with labels, such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed". You can create, manage, and deploy recommendations directly from [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer].
