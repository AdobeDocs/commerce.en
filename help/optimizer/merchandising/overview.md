# Merchandising

In this section you learn how to create personalized experiences for your shoppers through product discovery and recommendations.

## Product discovery

Product Discovery equips merchandisers with powerful tools to curate and optimize the shopping experience, ensuring that customers find the right products quickly, at the right time. By fine-tuning search behavior, you can directly influence product visibility, relevance, and conversion.

With product discovery, you can:

* **Configure [facets](./facets/overview.md), [merchandising rules](./rules/overview.md), and [synonyms](./synonyms/overview.md)** to guide shoppers toward the most relevant products with minimal friction.
* **Create intuitive, goal-oriented search experiences** that reflect your merchandising strategy and seasonal priorities.
* **Use AI-driven dynamic faceting and result re-ranking** to adapt search results in real time based on shopper behavior—boosting engagement and sales.
* **Ensure promotional and high-priority items surface effectively** to align search outcomes with business goals.

## Recommendations

Recommendations use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze aggregated visitor behavior and product interactions across your storefront. By combining this behavioral data with your product catalog, [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer] delivers highly personalized, relevant product suggestions that enhance shopper engagement and increase conversion.

Recommendations display on the storefront as labeled units—such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed". These units can be strategically placed throughout the shopping journey. As a merchandiser, you can easily create, manage, and deploy these recommendation units directly within [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer] to support promotional goals, cross-sell strategies, and personalized experiences.
