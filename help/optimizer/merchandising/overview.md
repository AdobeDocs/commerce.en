The list can be configured to calculate metrics for the last day, week, or month. You can use the metrics to create actionable insights based on how frequently a recommendation unit is viewed or clicked, or to analyze how well your recommendations perform.

You display these Recommendations on your storefront using the recommendations storefront component.
