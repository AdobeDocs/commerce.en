# Synonyms

Synonyms expand the search query to include words that shoppers might use that differ from those in your catalog. You don't want to lose a sale because someone is looking for a "sofa", while your product is listed as a "couch". You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words that customers might use to find your products.

[!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer] also supports [Search Term redirects](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/catalog/search/search-terms.html).
