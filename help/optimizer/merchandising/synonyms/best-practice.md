# Synonym Best Practices

Live Search manages misspellings by default. You can set up synonyms to include words that shoppers might use that differ from words specified in your catalog. You do not want to lose a sale because someone is looking for a "sofa", while your product is listed as a "couch". You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words that customers might use to find your products. You can [set synonyms as one way or two way](add.md#step-2-define-the-synonym-by-type) to improve results.

## Tips to optimize synonyms

- Map brand names and abbreviations to their full names, for example "HP" to "Hewlett-Packard" and common product nicknames, for example "iPhone" to "Apple iPhone".
- Include industry-specific jargon and terms that shoppers might use interchangeably, for example "sneakers" and "running shoes".
- Regularly update the synonym list based on new search trends, product additions, and shopper behavior.
- Test the effectiveness of synonym mappings by analyzing search results and shopper feedback. Refine mappings to improve accuracy and relevance.
