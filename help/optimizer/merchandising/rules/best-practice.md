# Merchandising Rules Best Practices

To optimize your conversion rate and revenue, you must implement effective search rules. Adjust product rankings based on sales data, stock levels, and promotions with [Merchandising rules](add.md#intelligent-ranking).

It is crucial to establish a well thought out default search rule. Your [default rule](overview.md#default-rule) determines how search results are initially sorted and displayed to shoppers, enhancing their overall experience and increasing the likelihood of purchase. Regular monitoring and adjustment of this rule ensures that it continues to meet shopper needs and business objectives effectively.

## Tips to optimize search rules

- Pin or boost products with high sales volumes or recent sales activity.
- Prioritize products with high ratings and positive reviews.
- Ensure that in-stock items are ranked higher.
- Slightly prioritize products with higher profit margins without compromising relevance.
- Highlight products that are on sale or part of special promotions.
- Set search rules during promotion or sales periods automatically by using the date range during your promotion period.
- Tailor search results based on individual shopper behavior using [intelligent ranking](add.md#intelligent-ranking), such as "recommended for you", "most viewed" and so on.
