# Merchandising Rules

Merchandising rules combine logic with actions to shape how products appear in **search results**, on **default product listings** (**All product listings**), and on **category pages** ([category rules](#category-rules) are in beta). You can boost, bury, pin, or hide products and apply **intelligent ranking** so listings reflect your business goals.

Each **search rule** has three main components:

- **Conditions** – Query-based requirements that trigger an action when the shopper's search matches.
- **Events** – The actions that take place when the conditions are met (manual ranking and related events).
- **Details** – The name of the rule, and optional time frame and description.

**Category rules** use **category selection** instead of search query conditions; intelligent ranking and manual ranking work the same way as for search, with differences called out in [Create and Manage Rules](add.md).

You can combine multiple conditions and actions for search rules, and schedule any rule to be active for a period. You can also set a **default rule** (**All product listings**) that applies when no more specific search or category rule applies.

## Category rules {#category-rules}

>Category rules are in beta.

**Category rules** control product order on **category pages**. You select one or more categories, then apply intelligent ranking (for example, most viewed, trending) and manual actions such as pin, boost, and bury. They do not use search query conditions. For setup steps, rule types, and how ranking applies on category versus search, see [Create and Manage Rules](add.md).

## Requirements

A simple **search rule** can have a single condition and a single event, while a complex rule can have up to ten conditions that trigger up to 25 events. **Category rules** follow the same event limits for manual ranking; they do not use query conditions.

Rules can have:

- Up to ten **conditions** (search rules only)
- Up to 25 **events**

Query text can contain:

- Alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers)
- Either upper or lowercase characters. Capitalization is ignored.

## Logical operators

The logical operators `AND` and `OR` join two conditions and return different results. All logical operators used in a rule with multiple conditions are the same. It is not possible to use both `AND` and `OR` in the same rule.

### Match operators

The Match operators `All` and `Any` determine the logical operator that is used to join multiple conditions in the rule, and can be used to change the existing operator.

- `All` - Uses the `AND` logical operator to join multiple conditions. A rule that uses the `All` Match operator can have only one `Search query is` condition.
- `Any` - Uses the `OR` logical operator to join multiple conditions.

When composing a complex rule, it can help to write it out with indentation to describe the conditions, associated events, and product names or SKUs that are needed to return the results you want to achieve. Then, build the rule and test the result.

## Default rule

You can set a default rule (**All product listings**) that applies when no search term is provided, or no other search rule can be applied. If you set the default rule to "Most Purchased", then queries default to that ranking type unless superseded by a more specific search term. No search term can be set for the default rule. **Category rules** are separate: they apply only to the categories you select and do not replace the default listing rule.

## Order of precedence with multiple rules

The following applies to **search rules** and how they interact for a given search. **Category rules** apply per category; see [Create and Manage Rules](add.md#category-rules) for how they fit alongside search and default rules.

Only one search rule is applied to a search term at any one time.
If multiple rules are found to be applicable to a search phrase, then all these rules are applied. If there is a collision between two rules---`rule 1` that boosts sku1 but `rule 2` hides the same SKU---then the most recently applied rule (`rule 2`) takes precedence.

- Rules are ordered by the "Last Modified" timestamp. The most recently modified rule is applied first, and older rules after that, in timestamp order.
- The `query is` condition takes precedence over other conditions. If a newer rule contains a `query contains` condition, but an older rule has a `query is` condition, the `query is` rule is applied.

### Storefront requests

If an active rule containing a `query is` condition matches the search phrase, it is applied. If there are multiple matching rules with a `query is` condition, the most recently updated active rule is applied.
Otherwise, the most recently updated active rule is applied.

### Preview requests

Request made in [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer] work slightly differently. When previewing [!DNL Adobe Commerce Optimizer], all rules are applied, including those expired and scheduled.

- If rule being previewed has a `query is` condition, it is applied.
- If rule being previewed does not have a `query is` condition, and a subsequent active, matching rule with a `query is` condition is found, the `query is` rule is applied.
- If rule being previewed does not have a `query is` condition, and no other rule with a `query is` condition is found, then the rule being previewed is applied.
