# Introduction to Recommendations

Recommendations are a powerful marketing tool that you can use to increase conversions, boost revenue, and stimulate shopper engagement. Recommendations are powered by [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html), which uses artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms to perform a deep analysis of aggregated visitor data. This data, when combined with your Adobe Commerce catalog, results in a highly engaging, relevant, and personalized experience.

Recommendations are surfaced on the storefront as units with labels, such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed". You can create, manage, and deploy recommendations across your store views directly from the Adobe Commerce Optimizer.

## Privacy

Data collection for the purposes of Recommendations does not include any personally identifiable information (PII). Also, all user identifiers like cookie IDs and IP addresses are strictly anonymized. To learn more, see the [Adobe Privacy Policy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html).

Recommendations users can refer to the [Data Management Dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/systems/data-transfer/data-dashboard.html) for more data about data syncing.
