# Recommendations Best Practices

Adobe recommends the following guidelines when using recommendations:

- Diversify your recommendation types. Customers start ignoring recommendations if they suggest the same products over and over again.

- Do not deploy the same recommendations to your cart page and order confirmation page. Consider using `Most Added to Cart` for the cart page and `Bought This, Bought That` for the order confirmation page.

- Keep your site tidy. Do not deploy more than three recommendation units on the same page.

- If your store sells clothing, the `More like this` recommendation can suggest gender-specific products that do not match the gender of the product being viewed. Consider using this recommendation type only for non-clothing categories.

## Placement

With so many recommendation types to choose from, which should you use on each page? If you are not sure where to begin, try the following:

|Page|Recommendation Type|
|---|---|
|Home page|`Recommended for you`|
|Product page|`Viewed this, viewed that`|
|Cart|`Bought this, bought that`|

You can track the [metrics](../../manage-results/recommendation-performance.md) and adjust if needed. Remember that experimentation is key.

## Recommendation labels

The label that is assigned to a recommendation in the storefront affects how shoppers interpret its relevancy to them. The following labels are frequently used for each type of recommendation.

|Recommendation Type|Recommended Labels|
|---|---|
|Most viewed<br> Most added to cart<br>Most purchased<br>Conversion (view to cart)<br>Conversion (view to purchase)|Most popular<br>Popular items<br>Trending<br>Popular right now<br>Recently popular<br>Popular items inspired by this item (PDP)<br>Top sellers<br>You might be interested in|
