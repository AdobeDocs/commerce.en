Product discovery enhances your site search functionality, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopper experience that maximizes conversion rates. It enables merchandisers to ensure that shoppers will get the right products at the right time. 

With product discovery, you can:

- Create meaningful search experiences to help shoppers and buyers find what they want with as little effort as possible.
- Take advantage of AI-powered dynamic faceting and re-ranking of search results in response to in-session shopper behaviors.
- Use a lightweight SaaS-based service that offers easy updates and is included in your license, reducing the total cost of ownership.
- Get technical by enabling GraphQL API, headless flexibility, API sandbox environments, and ultra fast SaaS.
