# Manage Commerce media assets with Product Visuals powered by AEM Assets

<!--In ACAP-844, this topic was linked to from the Commerce Admin products images and videos when the Assets integration is enabled. If the URL to the topic changes, be sure to add a redirect.-->

## Update an asset

After you edit an asset in AEM Assets, send the updates to Commerce by approving and reprocessing the asset. Only approved assets are sent to your Commerce instance. Reprocessing the asset ensures that any final changes or metadata updates are captured before the asset is sent to Adobe Commerce.

For details, see the following AEM Assets documentation.

## Add assets to categories content

After you have enabled and configured the AEM Assets integration, you can  add assets into your catalog categories content by using the AEM assets selector now available in the Commerce Admin.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Categories]**.

1. Expand the ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) in the **[!UICONTROL Content]** section.

   ![Category content](./assets/aem-assets-manage-categories.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. To display a **[!UICONTROL Category Image]** at the top of the page, click **[!UICONTROL Select from Assets]** to use an image from your AEM Assets folder.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and continue.

   For more information about creating a category, see [Complete the category content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/categories/create/category-create#step-3-complete-the-category-content).
