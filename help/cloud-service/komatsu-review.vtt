00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.405
<v Rick Buczynski>OK, looks like we're back here.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/243-0
00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:22.704
<v Rick Buczynski>So Nishant team, I,
I I take it you all have had a chance to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/243-1
00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Rick Buczynski>review the POV.
I know I sent it over maybe almost two</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/243-2
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.525
<v Rick Buczynski>weeks ago now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/253-0
00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:28.105
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah. Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/269-0
00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.252
<v Rick Buczynski>I'm happy to walk through it top to
bottom,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/269-1
00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:32.671
<v Rick Buczynski>but if you want to focus on any
particular points,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/269-2
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.805
<v Rick Buczynski>let me know and I can zoom into those
first.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/274-0
00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:36.565
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, I'm Brittany.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/293-0
00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:41.333
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Thank you for that.
And we would like to spend a little time</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/293-1
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.085
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>on Slide 6. And I just,
I have a few questions.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/310-0
00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:51.149
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And if we can keep it there and then we
can go to the recommendations,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/297-0
00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:47.555
<v Rick Buczynski>Sure.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/310-1
00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.005
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>so next slide.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/324-0
00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:55.554
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah,
I think the order might have changed at</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/315-0
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:54.445
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>You wanna share screen to watch?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/324-1
00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:56.125
<v Rick Buczynski>one point.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/331-0
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.405
<v Rick Buczynski>So is Slide 6 the Komatsu specific key
considerations.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/345-0
00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.266
<v Chanda Dani>No,
it has the list of limitations and seven</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/346-0
00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:05.735
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yes.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/345-1
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:05.675
<v Chanda Dani>things.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/350-0
00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.315
<v Chanda Dani>The key consideration.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/367-0
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.265
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, I'm.
I'm just looking at the let me share my</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/367-1
00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:11.115
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>screen so I can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/368-0
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.055
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah. OK. OK. Go ahead. Go ahead.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/370-0
00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:12.925
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/376-0
00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:28.445
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/382-0
00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:30.085
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, this is the one I was talking about.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/384-0
00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:31.195
<v Rick Buczynski>OK, OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/387-0
00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:31.675
<v Rick Buczynski>Got it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/406-0
00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:36.346
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>But if you want to just start from just
quickly cover anything prior to this,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/406-1
00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.845
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>just let me know which slide you want to
go to.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/410-0
00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:41.345
<v Rick Buczynski>We can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/418-0
00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:44.025
<v Rick Buczynski>We can stay on on that other slide.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/422-0
00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:45.025
<v Rick Buczynski>That's fine.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/427-0
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:45.065
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/428-0
00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:45.905
<v Rick Buczynski>I can talk through that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/439-0
00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:50.585
<v Rick Buczynski>So just just to speak to how it how the
storyline kind of gets to this point?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/477-0
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.458
<v Rick Buczynski>1st it's you know we we looked at general
considerations,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/477-1
00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:58.004
<v Rick Buczynski>then we looked at some Komatsu specific
considerations.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/477-2
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:03.069
<v Rick Buczynski>Meaning based on what we've designed or
built or based on our requirements set,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/477-3
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.905
<v Rick Buczynski>what should we watch out for?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/487-0
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:08.525
<v Rick Buczynski>And then we tried to take a composite of
those two and and kind of summarize.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/537-0
00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Rick Buczynski>Into this table here,
and this represents what I would say are</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/537-1
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.762
<v Rick Buczynski>some of the the key aspects or features
that we are either customizing for</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/537-2
00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:24.829
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu or we expect that there might be
some big differences between how it would</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/537-3
00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.045
<v Rick Buczynski>play out in SaaS versus PAAS models and
so.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/541-0
00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:27.855
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/553-0
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Rick Buczynski>We're highlighting them because these are
some of the driving forces behind our our</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/553-1
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.235
<v Rick Buczynski>current position right now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/558-0
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:34.465
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/573-0
00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:37.861
<v Rick Buczynski>So I I can go through each one if you
want me to elaborate on it then if you</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/573-1
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.045
<v Rick Buczynski>want to pause at anyone and.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/590-0
00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:45.267
<v Rick Buczynski>Maybe speak to how SAS can solve for that
in a way that's I guess equivalent to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/587-0
00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:44.495
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/590-1
00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:45.575
<v Rick Buczynski>pass.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/597-0
00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:47.175
<v Rick Buczynski>Is that is that how you guys want to do
this?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/606-0
00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.995
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yes, yes, please. And that sounds good.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/601-0
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:48.885
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/605-0
00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:50.965
<v Rick Buczynski>Got it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/656-0
00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:55.985
<v Rick Buczynski>So I think the the, the first one,
we already spoke about when we previously</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/656-1
00:02:55.985 --> 00:03:00.939
<v Rick Buczynski>met altogether and it had to do with
admin theme customizations the the key</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/656-2
00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.438
<v Rick Buczynski>use case for this as I explained
previously is that we were looking.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/656-3
00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:08.045
<v Rick Buczynski>We were hoping to adopt the majority of.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/660-0
00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:09.005
<v Rick Buczynski>The admin back office.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/674-0
00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:13.355
<v Rick Buczynski>For both Komatsu corporate employees and
dealer admins.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/708-0
00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:18.035
<v Rick Buczynski>And so you can think about Adobe Commerce
in that sense as more of like a</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/708-1
00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:22.835
<v Rick Buczynski>marketplace where Komatsu is the owner
operator and then each dealer is kind of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/708-2
00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.555
<v Rick Buczynski>a kind of a sub operator or reseller
within that marketplace.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/713-0
00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:27.275
<v Rick Buczynski>And so they would.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/729-0
00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:32.547
<v Rick Buczynski>They they should have a right to access
some administrative order management</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/729-1
00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:34.875
<v Rick Buczynski>capabilities and in that scenario.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/748-0
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Rick Buczynski>There was also requirement from Komatsu
to have a consistent look and feel across</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/748-1
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.285
<v Rick Buczynski>their enterprise applications.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/774-0
00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:47.767
<v Rick Buczynski>So what we know about Adobe Commerce is,
at least under the traditional PAA S</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/774-1
00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:51.715
<v Rick Buczynski>model is that it has an extensible admin
theming framework.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/782-0
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:53.715
<v Rick Buczynski>In fact, it's even well documented today.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/781-0
00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:54.235
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/820-0
00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:59.513
<v Rick Buczynski>Within the Experience League and we
actually tapped into that as a part of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/820-1
00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:03.649
<v Rick Buczynski>our design phase where we advocated for
doing a very lightweight themed</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/820-2
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:08.187
<v Rick Buczynski>customization to the admin just to change
the the color scheme and replace the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/820-3
00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.485
<v Rick Buczynski>Adobe logo in the top left with AK logo.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/848-0
00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:14.445
<v Rick Buczynski>And in doing so,
that actually seemed to be on par with</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/848-1
00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:18.425
<v Rick Buczynski>what they expected for consistency of
user experience across digital</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/848-2
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.175
<v Rick Buczynski>applications.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/879-0
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:23.897
<v Rick Buczynski>Because I I should mention that a dealer
today in Komatsu's ecosystem has to</v>

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:28.557
<v Rick Buczynski>interact with upwards of 15 different
apps and they all have a very similar</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/879-2
00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:29.415
<v Rick Buczynski>look and feel.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/901-0
00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:33.582
<v Rick Buczynski>And it was a it's critical that it looks
the same no matter which app they're</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/901-1
00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:36.627
<v Rick Buczynski>interacting with,
as long as we can streamline the login</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/901-2
00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:37.695
<v Rick Buczynski>via things like SSO.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/905-0
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.965
<v Rick Buczynski>So on this particular point.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/926-0
00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:44.213
<v Rick Buczynski>Immediately when we,
when we looked at the Saa's offering,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/926-1
00:04:44.213 --> 00:04:47.015
<v Rick Buczynski>we saw this,
this capability wasn't available.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/936-0
00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:50.135
<v Rick Buczynski>So that's why we're saying not supported
in SaaS and supported in Paas.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/945-0
00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:54.565
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So thank you Regin and and your
assessment is right.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/958-0
00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:59.765
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>We we currently do not have a capability
to adjust the team.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/964-0
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.245
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>My question is, in this scope of work.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/971-0
00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:07.245
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Do you include AEM? How is?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/983-0
00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:11.125
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>How are you doing this for other Adobe
applications?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/999-0
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:16.023
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Because I don't believe any of the Adobe
applications that are hosted on</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/999-1
00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:19.645
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>experience dot Adobe allow that
functionality either.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1015-0
00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:25.596
<v Rick Buczynski>Correct. Yeah. For AEM,
we actually have a very different use</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1015-1
00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:25.975
<v Rick Buczynski>case.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1026-0
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:32.375
<v Rick Buczynski>For AEM it's it's more content centric
and and thankfully in this business model.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1056-0
00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:38.094
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu is really operating the the main
entry point, which is komatsu.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1056-1
00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:41.485
<v Rick Buczynski>com and that's set to be kind of a global
representation.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1057-0
00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:42.655
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1064-0
00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:44.525
<v Rick Buczynski>That really doesn't.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1072-0
00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:49.765
<v Rick Buczynski>That's not an area of the business that
is within the control of each dealer.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1123-0
00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:54.578
<v Rick Buczynski>The dealer comes into play with
e-commerce and so really,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1123-1
00:05:54.578 --> 00:06:00.462
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu operates as kind of the the brand
and marketing engine for Komatsu and also</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1123-2
00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:04.315
<v Rick Buczynski>is the gateway or the doorway to their
dealer network.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1157-0
00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:07.614
<v Rick Buczynski>So anything upstream from the shopping
experience,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1119-0
00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:04.905
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1157-1
00:06:07.614 --> 00:06:10.455
<v Rick Buczynski>or I should say anything upstream from
from,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1157-2
00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:13.484
<v Rick Buczynski>from placing an order and having to
fulfill it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1157-3
00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:18.155
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu was actually managing that on
behalf of their dealers and and so.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1156-0
00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:17.185
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1162-0
00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:20.115
<v Rick Buczynski>So that's why order management
specifically.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1174-0
00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Rick Buczynski>Becomes a function for the dealers,
or at least where they have some</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1174-1
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.635
<v Rick Buczynski>interplay.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1182-0
00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:25.315
<v Rick Buczynski>Now there, there there is.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1221-0
00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:30.703
<v Rick Buczynski>I will clarify that to say that there is
a different requirement that has to do</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1221-1
00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:36.192
<v Rick Buczynski>with promotions management and this is an
area where content may come into play and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1221-2
00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:41.484
<v Rick Buczynski>so we haven't actually designed this yet,
but there is a requirement on our road</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1221-3
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.595
<v Rick Buczynski>map that asks to.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1230-0
00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:45.715
<v Rick Buczynski>Have an ability for a dealer to create a
promo banner.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1237-0
00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:47.725
<v Rick Buczynski>That would be attached to a promo.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1305-0
00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:50.821
<v Rick Buczynski>Now we all know that in Adobe Commerce,
out-of-the-box,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1305-1
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.915
<v Rick Buczynski>that's a built in capability with some of
its core CMS features.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1305-2
00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:56.105
<v Rick Buczynski>Although I think with within the Saa's
model,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1305-3
00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:58.675
<v Rick Buczynski>I didn't actually check if that's been
stripped away.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1321-0
00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:02.622
<v Rick Buczynski>I don't recall,
but in either case when when we looked at</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1321-1
00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.015
<v Rick Buczynski>that particular feature.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1351-0
00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:08.825
<v Rick Buczynski>We were a little bit concerned because at
first we thought, well,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1351-1
00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:12.441
<v Rick Buczynski>if we're using AEM for all content
management then do we have to onboard</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1351-2
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.075
<v Rick Buczynski>dealers into that system as well?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1363-0
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:18.555
<v Rick Buczynski>The answer given the current state of
Adobe commerce on Paas is is no.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1401-0
00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.955
<v Rick Buczynski>That's a true e-commerce centric
capability that's tied directly to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1401-1
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:25.905
<v Rick Buczynski>promotions and offers and the built in
functionality of Adobe Commerce fit the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1372-0
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:24.435
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1401-2
00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:28.305
<v Rick Buczynski>spec.
So we can keep them there for for what we</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1379-0
00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:27.675
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1401-3
00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:29.355
<v Rick Buczynski>would end up calling.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1407-0
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:32.305
<v Rick Buczynski>Extremely lightweight content management.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1409-0
00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:36.195
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>All right.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1418-0
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.685
<v Rick Buczynski>Any questions or comments on that or I
can go to the next one.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1421-0
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:42.905
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Anybody.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1426-0
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:47.005
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Need to do some investigation around our
options here, so thank you for that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1429-0
00:07:48.305 --> 00:07:50.025
<v Rick Buczynski>Sure. OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1452-0
00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:54.161
<v Rick Buczynski>So the next one on extensible core admin
screens we we actually talked about this</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1452-1
00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:55.825
<v Rick Buczynski>and we we got some clarification.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1457-0
00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:57.865
<v Rick Buczynski>I I was actually mistaken at one point
that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1471-0
00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:02.951
<v Rick Buczynski>You,
you you had fewer extension points than</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1471-1
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:04.115
<v Rick Buczynski>you actually do.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1482-0
00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:07.435
<v Rick Buczynski>It is still much more limited than in the
current Paas offering.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1507-0
00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:11.171
<v Rick Buczynski>So so our disposition,
if we had to summarize it in just a few</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1507-1
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:14.770
<v Rick Buczynski>words in the SaaS model,
we're saying it's limited control or</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1507-2
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.555
<v Rick Buczynski>extension points as compared to the past
model.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1527-0
00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:22.879
<v Rick Buczynski>Which has full control over each screen
individually and the the example that we</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1519-0
00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:21.695
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Correct. Yep, correct.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1527-1
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.905
<v Rick Buczynski>gave when we spoke last was that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1538-0
00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:30.525
<v Rick Buczynski>There were some unique things that we
might need to do to say.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1552-0
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:37.745
<v Rick Buczynski>Preset filters in a grid based on the
current dealer scope of data.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1549-0
00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:37.515
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1574-0
00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.702
<v Rick Buczynski>So they might only have visibility over
certain customers that that is not a</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1560-0
00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:41.355
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1574-1
00:08:41.702 --> 00:08:44.825
<v Rick Buczynski>filter that a dealer should have the
right to set on their own.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1593-0
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:48.864
<v Rick Buczynski>That should be a preset filter that we
apply kind of behind the scenes on that</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1593-1
00:08:48.864 --> 00:08:51.625

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.705
<v Rick Buczynski>Portions of the filtering controls.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1635-0
00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:59.982
<v Rick Buczynski>Was just one example in our discussions
about the requirements with Komatsu up to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1635-1
00:08:59.982 --> 00:09:03.141
<v Rick Buczynski>this point,
we have been very careful to say that we</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1635-2
00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:06.895
<v Rick Buczynski>don't want to advocate for major
customizations to the layout.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1659-0
00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:10.722
<v Rick Buczynski>So for example,
if your typical layout in the admin panel</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1659-1
00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:14.021
<v Rick Buczynski>only gives you a filter at top,
a scope selector,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1659-2
00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:18.375
<v Rick Buczynski>and a table with your records,
you know a typical CRUD interface.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1661-0
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:19.285
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1686-0
00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Rick Buczynski>We would advocate for not modifying that
unless we had to, but Even so,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1686-1
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.545
<v Rick Buczynski>there are a few requirements we've
encountered where.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1680-0
00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:24.425
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1736-0
00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:31.573
<v Rick Buczynski>We don't feel that this current
extensibility options on the SaaS model</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1736-1
00:09:31.573 --> 00:09:36.446
<v Rick Buczynski>for I'll say modifying core admin screens
is gonna fit our requirements set.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1736-2
00:09:36.446 --> 00:09:40.940
<v Rick Buczynski>So we'd have to find a work around and
and in considering workarounds,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1736-3
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.105
<v Rick Buczynski>we do know that with the admin UI SDK we
can rec.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1752-0
00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:47.251
<v Rick Buczynski>Screens as needed,
but the concern there which I think I</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1752-1
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.815
<v Rick Buczynski>also explained previously is.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1762-0
00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:53.385
<v Rick Buczynski>Recreating a core order admin screen.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1769-0
00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:56.625
<v Rick Buczynski>Kind of defeats the purpose of the
out-of-the-box value.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1774-0
00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:57.775
<v Rick Buczynski>Adobe commerce.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1773-0
00:09:57.525 --> 00:09:57.925
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1784-0
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:01.825
<v Rick Buczynski>O we felt that that also wasn't viable.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1789-0
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:03.385
<v Rick Buczynski>It was kind of a last resort option.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1791-0
00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:04.375
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1812-0
00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:10.231
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.
And and I guess what I just said covers</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1812-1
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:12.505
<v Rick Buczynski>the Third Point as well for extensible
new administrants.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1818-0
00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:13.985
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yes. Can I just ask a quick question?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1829-0
00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:16.585
<v Rick Buczynski>So that one is is supported between
mobile? Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1840-0
00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:17.359
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, just a quick question, Rick.
So on all these pieces,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1840-1
00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:21.305
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>it sounds like this core order admin
screen is really not the heart.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1849-0
00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:22.905
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I mean all these add up together, right?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1855-0
00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.305
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>The customization's on the back end.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1888-0
00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:28.633
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Some of the major filters on the on these
different grids,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1888-1
00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:33.201
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>but is that really kind of the the heart
is on this admin screen and really kind</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1888-2
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:36.585
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>of because the other parts we could maybe
look at possibly?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1901-0
00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:38.654
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>But really,
is that kind of where the heart of the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1901-1
00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:39.415
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>matter is on a lot of this?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1908-0
00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.525
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Just kinda curious.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1939-0
00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:43.120
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah,
probably order processing is the biggest</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1939-1
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.567
<v Rick Buczynski>point for dealers based on what I know
about the requirement set,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1924-0
00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:45.115
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep, Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1939-2
00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:48.865
<v Rick Buczynski>there may be a future where they have
some.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1931-0
00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:47.025
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1941-0
00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:49.545
<v Rick Buczynski>We we haven't.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1965-0
00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:53.488
<v Rick Buczynski>We haven't really talked about this or
sorry, we talked about it,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1965-1
00:10:53.488 --> 00:10:58.268
<v Rick Buczynski>but I would say it's not on the road map
for for our commercial launch deadline</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1965-2
00:10:58.268 --> 00:10:58.865
<v Rick Buczynski>right now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1980-0
00:10:58.865 --> 00:11:03.494
<v Rick Buczynski>But one thing that we've talked about is
whether or not we want to allow dealers</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1976-0
00:11:01.135 --> 00:11:01.335
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1980-1
00:11:03.494 --> 00:11:03.665
<v Rick Buczynski>to.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1992-0
00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:09.505
<v Rick Buczynski>Manage an extension of the catalog that
represents their own product sets.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/1999-0
00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:11.695
<v Rick Buczynski>So in in komatsu's business.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2022-0
00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:18.786
<v Rick Buczynski>A dealer can technically and legally
carry and sell both Komatsu and non</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2022-1
00:11:18.786 --> 00:11:20.665
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu after market parts.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2041-0
00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:25.112
<v Rick Buczynski>Komatsu doesn't really have a problem
with this,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2041-1
00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:27.705
<v Rick Buczynski>but where it becomes a problem is that
Komatsu?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2078-0
00:11:30.175 --> 00:11:34.972
<v Rick Buczynski>Is really the provider of all Komatsu
parts from a master data source and all</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2078-1
00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:39.645
<v Rick Buczynski>dealers in North America are going to
receive the same catalog based set of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2078-2
00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:43.335
<v Rick Buczynski>aftermarket parts from a global PIM which
Komatsu controls.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2110-0
00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:47.137
<v Rick Buczynski>So the question becomes,
what do we do with all the other parts</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2110-1
00:11:47.137 --> 00:11:50.922
<v Rick Buczynski>that if you walked into a dealer,
you could buy off of their shelf?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2110-2
00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:54.819
<v Rick Buczynski>Shouldn't those non Komatsu brand
aftermarket parts also be available</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2110-3
00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:55.375
<v Rick Buczynski>digitally?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2123-0
00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:59.545
<v Rick Buczynski>And so in that scenario,
there may be a requirement whereby.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2117-0
00:11:57.195 --> 00:11:57.355
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2149-0
00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:03.792
<v Rick Buczynski>By the dealer should have the ability to
manage,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2149-1
00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:10.335
<v Rick Buczynski>I'll say an additional subset catalog on
their own. They'll need a home to do that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2171-0
00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:13.680
<v Rick Buczynski>Adobe Commerce may be a place for that.
I can't guarantee that at this point,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2171-1
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.895
<v Rick Buczynski>but those are just some of the thoughts
that are coming to mind right now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2172-0
00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:17.445
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2193-0
00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:21.116
<v Rick Buczynski>So catalog order management,
those are definitely admin controls and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2193-1
00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:24.752
<v Rick Buczynski>also promo management.
That's a huge piece because Komatsu gives</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2193-2
00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:25.815
<v Rick Buczynski>control to dealers.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2200-0
00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:28.425
<v Rick Buczynski>To set some of their own marketing
promotions.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2238-0
00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:35.760
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I think on that catalog piece,
we could look at,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2238-1
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.359
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>but I think going back to that quarter
admin, that's kind of where, yeah,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2238-2
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:45.269
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>we we need to categorize these and do
some deep dives and brainstorming on how</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2238-3
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:47.195
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>we can figure this out overall.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2264-0
00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:53.312
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So if we keep going down the list, though,
we talk about in process execution</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2264-1
00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:57.491
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>customization.
So like like for sure that's changing,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2264-2
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:57.955
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>right?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2271-0
00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:01.215
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Because it'll be at builder based or
microservices based.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2277-0
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:03.765

00:13:03.765 --> 00:13:06.825
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I mean,
I understand is different than in process,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2293-1
00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:10.485
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>but that is that is part of what we're
doing with with SaaS.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2315-0
00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:14.046
<v Rick Buczynski>Oh oh, for sure. I guess you know.
More fundamentally, for me,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2315-1
00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:17.895
<v Rick Buczynski>some of this is a mindset shift.
But I also think it's AI.</v>

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:17.415
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

00:13:18.975 --> 00:13:24.098
<v Rick Buczynski>Think personally for me, Adobe,
you will begin to realize that the power</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2335-1
00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:27.255
<v Rick Buczynski>and flexibility of in process

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2366-0
00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:32.728
<v Rick Buczynski>Moving away from that to out of process

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:37.048
<v Rick Buczynski>the capabilities of your product road map

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.465
<v Rick Buczynski>of customers that have adopted Adobe

00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:44.055
<v Rick Buczynski>Specifically because of its inherent

00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:46.442
<v Rick Buczynski>So as you look to pull that out of

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2380-0
00:13:44.765 --> 00:13:44.925
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:50.479
<v Rick Buczynski>you will find that there are actual

00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:52.943

00:13:52.943 --> 00:13:56.875
<v Rick Buczynski>And there's going to be a point of time
at which you have to catch up, so.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2417-0
00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:54.595

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:02.616
<v Rick Buczynski>we actually take that very seriously
because the our ability to build</v>

00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:13.314
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, the the the downside to that,
as you well know is you know the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2477-1
00:14:13.314 --> 00:14:17.485
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>customers are really complaining about

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2497-0
00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:22.862
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So when when all the changes happen,

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:26.005
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So so it's a.</v>

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:24.115

00:14:26.005 --> 00:14:28.165
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>It's a it's a two-part problem, right?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2516-0
00:14:28.165 --> 00:14:31.845
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>We solve it one way,

00:14:31.845 --> 00:14:32.925

00:14:33.815 --> 00:14:37.055

00:17:06.142 --> 00:17:08.067
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>and then you get you know as we solve
that,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2969-3
00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:10.605
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>are there any other things that come to
mind in your top?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2987-0
00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:14.322
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Two outside of that or chasing towards
now on our side.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2987-1
00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:16.645
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And this is a very common feedback.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2992-0
00:17:15.255 --> 00:17:16.775
<v Rick Buczynski>No, I don't think so.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/2994-0
00:17:16.645 --> 00:17:17.485
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, a very common.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3014-0
00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:20.260
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep,
we we get this from from other partners</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3014-1
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.206
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>as well and that's why we have
prioritized this and and this is</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3014-2
00:17:24.206 --> 00:17:27.165
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>something we are actively looking to
solve and.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3021-0
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:29.455
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>We we'll have something.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3037-0
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:34.841
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>In near future to to show you and maybe
you can kick the tires and see if that's</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3037-1
00:17:34.841 --> 00:17:35.605
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>good enough.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3042-0
00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:38.075
<v Rick Buczynski>Sure. Yeah, we have a.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3054-0
00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:41.897
<v Rick Buczynski>We have a requirement in our road map
right now that is part of our commercial</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3054-1
00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:42.235
<v Rick Buczynski>launch.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3056-0
00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:43.905
<v Rick Buczynski>Commitment.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3078-0
00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:48.989
<v Rick Buczynski>Where actually I think Nishant I sent
something to you.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3078-1
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:51.945
<v Rick Buczynski>And Surya months ago I showed you a
preview concept.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3083-0
00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.025
<v Rick Buczynski>This was like back in November.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3116-0
00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:57.821
<v Rick Buczynski>December about a notification engine
where we were looking to route</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3116-1
00:17:57.821 --> 00:18:03.111
<v Rick Buczynski>notifications using Adobe IO and App
Builder and then subsequently publish</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3116-2
00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:07.625
<v Rick Buczynski>them into a custom app that Komatsu had
within their ecosystem.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3133-0
00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:11.979
<v Rick Buczynski>But we needed a place to store those
notifications because Adobe IO is not</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3133-1
00:18:11.979 --> 00:18:13.295
<v Rick Buczynski>meant for long term storage.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3136-0
00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:14.095
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3144-0
00:18:14.825 --> 00:18:16.625
<v Rick Buczynski>And at the time we we realized, OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3147-0
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:17.305
<v Rick Buczynski>That's a gap.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3180-0
00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:22.301
<v Rick Buczynski>So I just had a conversation this week
and I had to reinforce that as a gap and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3180-1
00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:27.226
<v Rick Buczynski>I said will need likely some kind of a
simple rest service on top of a database</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3180-2
00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:30.735
<v Rick Buczynski>that Komatsu provides out of their cloud
infrastructure.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3188-0
00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:32.685
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, Jack, go ahead.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3221-0
00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Jack Lull>Just reaching for the mute button so the
presentation I gave you to gave to other</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3221-1
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.405
<v Jack Lull>SIS as well and one of the questions that
came up was OK, since, you know,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3221-2
00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:52.555
<v Jack Lull>we haven't committed to a early access
program yet.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3225-0
00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:54.715
<v Jack Lull>Soon, that's what Nishant said.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3228-0
00:18:54.715 --> 00:18:55.395
<v Jack Lull>Which I would.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3230-0
00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:55.395
<v Rick Buczynski>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3239-0
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:57.955
<v Jack Lull>I would back up,
but we still don't have definitive dates.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3254-0
00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:04.135
<v Jack Lull>They said, well, listen,
if I was to in my development environment,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3254-1
00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:05.105
<v Jack Lull>connect up to.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3284-0
00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:12.953
<v Jack Lull>AWS Documentdb using because it's it's a
MongoDB style API.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3284-1
00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:16.455
<v Jack Lull>Would that allow me to develop?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3316-0
00:19:16.695 --> 00:19:20.294
<v Jack Lull>Obviously it's not a great deployment
solution,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3316-1
00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:26.217
<v Jack Lull>but it would at least allow me to develop
and what would be the challenge with</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3316-2
00:19:26.217 --> 00:19:30.415
<v Jack Lull>upgrading from using that Mongo DB live
in app Builder?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3318-0
00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:31.385
<v Jack Lull>To.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3326-0
00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.665
<v Jack Lull>What you have when you have this.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3348-0
00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:40.789
<v Jack Lull>This document style persistence in app
builder itself and the answer was that</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3348-1
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:44.495
<v Jack Lull>was a great idea because you can
absolutely do that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3370-0
00:19:46.105 --> 00:19:54.011
<v Jack Lull>That we at this point we've got our
surrogate for the Mongo DB JavaScript</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3370-1
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:54.865
<v Jack Lull>library.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3391-0
00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:59.798
<v Jack Lull>Pretty much fleshed out, you know,
in our proof of concept it's it's</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3391-1
00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:03.475
<v Jack Lull>actually functioning and you know we'll
be able to expose that as part of the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3391-2
00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:04.465
<v Jack Lull>Early Access program.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3442-0
00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:10.614
<v Jack Lull>We could certainly because it's not 100%
of of the Mongo DB interface, but one.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3442-1
00:20:10.614 --> 00:20:15.781
<v Jack Lull>One thing that might be a short term
solution for this particular gap is to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3442-2
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:19.792
<v Jack Lull>look at. You know,
what can I do for development right now</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3442-3
00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:21.015
<v Jack Lull>until soon occurs.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3461-0
00:20:22.665 --> 00:20:25.885
<v Jack Lull>And and if if that was your biggest
obstacle,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3461-1
00:20:25.885 --> 00:20:28.545
<v Jack Lull>then at least make a dent in the list.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3460-0
00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:28.955
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I think.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3473-0
00:20:31.225 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah,
that's actually a really good thought,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3473-1
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.905
<v Rick Buczynski>Jack, we can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3483-0
00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:39.505
<v Rick Buczynski>We can consider that in our case we'd be
working with Azure.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3510-0
00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:43.653
<v Rick Buczynski>So I don't know if that would be more
aligned to Cosmos DB and I don't know if</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3510-1
00:20:43.653 --> 00:20:45.905
<v Rick Buczynski>there's compatibility on the interface
there.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3518-0
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:47.605
<v Jack Lull>Mongre you can use Mongo.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3521-0
00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:48.855
<v Rick Buczynski>OK, OK, OK. You can use Mongo directly.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3522-0
00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:49.615
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, we can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3526-0
00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:51.135
<v Rick Buczynski>We can look into that, I think that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3538-0
00:20:52.815 --> 00:20:55.615
<v Rick Buczynski>That's probably gonna be coming up in the
next week or so anyway.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3539-0
00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:55.625
<v Rick Buczynski>I.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3551-0
00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:59.612
<v Rick Buczynski>I I literally just had a call two days
ago with the team about what options do</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3551-1
00:20:59.612 --> 00:21:00.015
<v Rick Buczynski>we have.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3559-0
00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:02.615
<v Rick Buczynski>They they actually have some other ideas
in mind. Just just FYI.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3581-0
00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Rick Buczynski>I they have a they have a master data
plane service that they call Palantir and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3581-1
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.765
<v Rick Buczynski>they've been looking at using that for
many reasons.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3590-0
00:21:12.765 --> 00:21:15.365
<v Rick Buczynski>So we've got some options on the table,
but we can keep this in mind.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3601-0
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.385
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>What was the timeline again for this?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3615-0
00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:21.873
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Sorry,
just trying to recall what the in terms</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3618-0
00:21:20.975 --> 00:21:23.575
<v Rick Buczynski>Current timeline current timeline.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3615-1
00:21:21.873 --> 00:21:22.825
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>of starting, yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3642-0
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.376
<v Rick Buczynski>Well,
we're actually in a we're in an SIT phase</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3642-1
00:21:26.376 --> 00:21:31.160
<v Rick Buczynski>right now for what we call a quiet launch,
which will launch predominantly AEM in</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3629-0

00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:10.815

00:22:10.815 --> 00:22:13.854
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Is this something that as we evolve on

00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:18.505
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>you can keep the customer posted on

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3796-0
00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:21.854
<v Rick Buczynski>Absolutely.
There's there is a ton of attention on</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3796-1
00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:26.505
<v Rick Buczynski>this right now in the both it and
business are asking what's our POV.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3780-0
00:22:22.285 --> 00:22:22.565
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3797-0
00:22:27.105 --> 00:22:28.585
<v Rick Buczynski>Why should we stay?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3804-0
00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:30.345
<v Rick Buczynski>Why shouldn't we stay where we are?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3805-0
00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:31.235
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3828-0
00:22:31.855 --> 00:22:34.244
<v Rick Buczynski>And what can we do to even if we stay the
course,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3828-1
00:22:34.244 --> 00:22:36.775
<v Rick Buczynski>what can we do to make sure that we're

00:22:36.775 --> 00:22:39.952
<v Rick Buczynski>So as a key point,
I think it's at the bottom of this</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3848-1
00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:43.775

I had said there's things we can do now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3840-0
00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:41.405
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3854-0
00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:46.605
<v Rick Buczynski>So for example,
what can be out of process should be out</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3854-1
00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:47.135

00:22:47.765 --> 00:22:52.976
<v Rick Buczynski>That at least reduce the the surface area
that has to be transitioned should they</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3857-0
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:48.255
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Cool.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3883-1
00:22:52.976 --> 00:22:54.565
<v Rick Buczynski>go to a SaaS based model.</v>

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:17.505
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I do believe we we support that through

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:21.865

00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:26.135
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/3976-1
00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:30.295
<v Rick Buczynski>technically do this in a number of
different ways.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4002-0
00:23:30.455 --> 00:23:35.637
<v Rick Buczynski>I so I should acknowledge that API mesh
might be a mechanism for augmenting</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4002-1
00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:40.136
<v Rick Buczynski>out-of-the-box APIs where they're not
sufficient. With, you know,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4002-2
00:23:40.136 --> 00:23:41.295
<v Rick Buczynski>other structures.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4019-0
00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:48.455
<v Rick Buczynski>But inherently the rest and graph QL AP
is to my knowledge on the SaaS model.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4026-0
00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.375

00:23:51.645 --> 00:23:55.973
<v Rick Buczynski>They are within the past model,
meaning if we needed to include some</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4063-1
00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:59.862
<v Rick Buczynski>unique objects and data structures that
would augment, say a,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4063-2
00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:04.189
<v Rick Buczynski>say a core entity or a core object over
the rest API or gql surface.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4063-3
00:24:04.189 --> 00:24:07.325
<v Rick Buczynski>I don't believe we can do that in the

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4073-0
00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:11.175
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Not even through aapm mesh.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4080-0
00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:12.695
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I mean that would be the place to do it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4091-0
00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:16.025
<v Rick Buczynski>Through through API mesh we could. Yeah.
So that's why I said maybe I should.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4099-0
00:24:16.025 --> 00:24:18.825
<v Rick Buczynski>I should correct my statement on this
'cause just as you asked it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4107-0
00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:20.425
<v Rick Buczynski>I wasn't even thinking about API mesh.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4124-0
00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:26.357
<v Rick Buczynski>We could do some some custom resolvers as
an example that will modify the schema</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4124-1
00:24:26.357 --> 00:24:28.465

<v Jack Lull>Yeah. So in in ACCS,

00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:44.669

00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:47.345

00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:51.917

00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:15.686
<v Rick Buczynski>Well,
maybe that's something for us to look</v>

00:25:16.275 --> 00:25:22.807
<v Rick Buczynski>I guess depending on the approach I guess
I would change my statement to say not</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4285-1

<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And Rick, if you have any,
as you're doing that deeper dive with SAS</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4303-1
00:25:35.982 --> 00:25:39.215
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>versus pass on the data model

00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:42.785
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Another use case or two that you need us

00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:49.875

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4350-0
00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:53.900
<v Rick Buczynski>I know we're brought up on time,
but the data model extensibility has</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4350-1
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.315
<v Rick Buczynski>actually been a a really important one
for us historically.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4349-0
00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:57.525
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4353-0
00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:00.255
<v Rick Buczynski>Because.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4396-0
00:26:00.335 --> 00:26:04.931
<v Rick Buczynski>I've never I I've almost never done an
implementation for a customer,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4396-1
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:10.314
<v Rick Buczynski>especially in the B2B space that has been
able to utilize a A core Adobe commerce</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4396-2
00:26:10.314 --> 00:26:14.975
<v Rick Buczynski>data model as is out-of-the-box,
there are always modifications to it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4406-0
00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:17.535
<v Rick Buczynski>And you know we we've always extended it
according to best practices.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4402-0
00:26:15.925 --> 00:26:16.045
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4427-0
00:26:18.005 --> 00:26:21.795
<v Rick Buczynski>But Even so,
the data model needs a comprehensive</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4427-1
00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:25.205
<v Rick Buczynski>extensibility framework to go with it
again.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4470-0
00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:28.007
<v Rick Buczynski>Otherwise,
for the same reason that if you if you</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4470-1
00:26:28.007 --> 00:26:31.144
<v Rick Buczynski>systematically have to recreate all core
admin screens,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4470-2
00:26:31.144 --> 00:26:35.627
<v Rick Buczynski>then you start to whittle away at the
value of the platform itself and actually</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4459-0
00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:35.255
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah. Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4470-3
00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:39.885
<v Rick Buczynski>going through this exercise you know one
of the thoughts I had in mind was.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4488-0
00:26:43.385 --> 00:26:47.218
<v Rick Buczynski>Why doesn't Adobe Commerce one day just
become totally headless and be purely API</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4488-1
00:26:47.218 --> 00:26:47.545
<v Rick Buczynski>driven?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4516-0
00:26:48.305 --> 00:26:52.512
<v Rick Buczynski>Because then you could at least put focus
on extensibility on one surface as</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4516-1
00:26:52.512 --> 00:26:56.882
<v Rick Buczynski>opposed to having to try to juggle the
concerns of every industry specific need</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4516-2
00:26:56.882 --> 00:26:57.865
<v Rick Buczynski>across 2 surfaces.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4533-0
00:26:57.945 --> 00:27:01.389
<v Rick Buczynski>The UI and the API that it was just,
you know thoughts going through my head</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4533-1
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:02.865
<v Rick Buczynski>as we went through this exercise.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4538-0
00:27:02.865 --> 00:27:06.185
<v Rick Buczynski>But I think it just reinforces the point
that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4550-0
00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:11.735
<v Rick Buczynski>The for for as flexible as the platform
is.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4567-0
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:16.654
<v Rick Buczynski>Across industry,
time has told us that every industry's</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4567-1
00:27:16.654 --> 00:27:19.485
<v Rick Buczynski>business model is like a snowflake.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4604-0
00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:23.192
<v Rick Buczynski>Even there are there are snowflakes
within and I don't even think it's</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4572-0
00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:20.755
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4604-1
00:27:23.192 --> 00:27:26.794
<v Rick Buczynski>realistic for a single commerce platform
to pretend that it can have</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4604-2
00:27:26.794 --> 00:27:30.657
<v Rick Buczynski>out-of-the-box business processes and
data models that would actually fit</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4604-3
00:27:30.657 --> 00:27:31.805

<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>It's a great point.</v>

00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:36.525
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>It's a great point to make on data model
extensibility.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4621-0
00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:38.005
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Have you checked out the new AP?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4625-0
00:27:38.005 --> 00:27:40.645
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Is that we have released with SaaS.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4631-0
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:43.415
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>'Cause now you can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4636-0
00:27:43.415 --> 00:27:45.255
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>You can extend core entities.</v>

00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:48.175
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Then go goes beyond product and customer.</v>

00:27:48.175 --> 00:27:50.535

00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:57.145
<v Rick Buczynski>I may maybe if you can send me a link to
that I may know what you're talking about.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4667-0
00:27:55.915 --> 00:27:56.715
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I I will.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4688-0
00:27:58.575 --> 00:28:02.358
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And then as you look at that,
if you have any other feedback for us,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4688-1

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4692-0
00:28:03.665 --> 00:28:05.385
<v Rick Buczynski>Sure. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4712-0
00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:10.952
<v Rick Buczynski>So key key take away for us on this is
and I don't even I didn't even mention it,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4712-1
00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:14.065
<v Rick Buczynski>but the one in the middle about B2B
functionality.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4725-0
00:28:14.105 --> 00:28:18.425
<v Rick Buczynski>Our understanding is that won't be
available until 2026, unfortunately.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4772-0
00:28:18.495 --> 00:28:22.073
<v Rick Buczynski>In our case,
we are reliant upon that for the use of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4772-1
00:28:22.073 --> 00:28:26.731
<v Rick Buczynski>the company entity for quoting
functionality and piggybacking off of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4772-2
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:30.985
<v Rick Buczynski>that to support some dealer specific data
model augmentations.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4772-3
00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:35.575
<v Rick Buczynski>Because dealer as a as a data entity
doesn't exist within commerce.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4820-0
00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:40.283
<v Rick Buczynski>That,
I think was kind of a non starter for us</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4820-1
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:45.964
<v Rick Buczynski>and we've already experienced a number of
delays on this project that we feel that</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4820-2
00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:51.235
<v Rick Buczynski>pursuing SaaS by by way of pausing the
project now to kind of rediscover and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4820-3
00:28:51.235 --> 00:28:53.905
<v Rick Buczynski>refactor to adopt it is is just not in.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4845-0
00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:56.500
<v Rick Buczynski>The cards for us,
I think it would be we're we're</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4845-1
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.771
<v Rick Buczynski>estimating up to five months of delay on
that knowing all of the moving parts and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4845-2
00:29:00.771 --> 00:29:01.865
<v Rick Buczynski>interdependent teams.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4853-0
00:29:02.735 --> 00:29:05.015
<v Rick Buczynski>I just don't think the business can
stomach that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4888-0
00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:08.696
<v Rick Buczynski>At this time.
So so as I said at the end of the report,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4888-1
00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:13.633
<v Rick Buczynski>the best thing we can do right now is a
future ready risk mitigation factor is to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4888-2
00:29:13.633 --> 00:29:17.485
<v Rick Buczynski>move much more consistently towards auto
process extensibility.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4889-0
00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:18.035
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Mm hmm yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4912-0
00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:26.342
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So this B2B are you just referring to
headless or are are you using Luma for</v>

00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:28.065
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>front end components?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4931-0
00:29:28.885 --> 00:29:34.452
<v Rick Buczynski>In in well for the admin components too.
So for the core admin functionality like</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4931-1
00:29:34.452 --> 00:29:36.285

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:40.231
<v Rick Buczynski>But yeah,
on the front end it would be purely API</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4943-1
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:40.575
<v Rick Buczynski>driven.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4964-0
00:29:42.255 --> 00:29:47.779
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And and I mean we we do support all of
that in in SaaS like B2B is</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4964-1
00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:49.015
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>out-of-the-box.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4973-0
00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:52.855
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So all company management and quoting all
of that is there.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4978-0
00:29:53.435 --> 00:29:54.315
<v Rick Buczynski>So we do.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4995-0
00:29:54.315 --> 00:29:58.729
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, we do have a need on. Oh. Oh, wait,
wait, wait. So Even so. OK,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/4995-1
00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:01.755
<v Rick Buczynski>then maybe I need to take a look at that
again.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5020-0
00:30:02.475 --> 00:30:10.315
<v Rick Buczynski>So all of the IT has parity with the past
capabilities in terms of rest, AP is.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5025-0
00:30:08.605 --> 00:30:11.965
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>It it it comes with B2B module pre
installed.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5031-0
00:30:12.485 --> 00:30:13.525
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So that's default.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5033-0
00:30:12.965 --> 00:30:13.365
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5045-0
00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:16.245
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, with API server APIs with.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5082-0
00:30:14.405 --> 00:30:18.975
<v Rick Buczynski>The OK I I will look at that again.
But one other point to make about that is</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5082-1
00:30:18.975 --> 00:30:22.959
<v Rick Buczynski>even within the B2B modules,
there are some changes that have to be</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5082-2
00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:26.005
<v Rick Buczynski>made to like say the quoting process as
an example.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5085-0
00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:26.705
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah. Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5095-0
00:30:26.045 --> 00:30:29.072
<v Rick Buczynski>They're they're they're generally
lightweight,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5095-1
00:30:29.072 --> 00:30:32.485
<v Rick Buczynski>but not lightweight enough that we feel
that we can.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5107-0
00:30:33.975 --> 00:30:37.255
<v Rick Buczynski>We can implement them separately from
that core module.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5127-0
00:30:37.255 --> 00:30:39.392
<v Rick Buczynski>It has to be like baked into the admin
experience,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5127-1
00:30:39.392 --> 00:30:42.535
<v Rick Buczynski>otherwise we have to recreate the whole
admin interface from from scratch.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5120-0
00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:40.845
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5129-0
00:30:42.805 --> 00:30:43.005
<v Rick Buczynski>Match.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5166-0
00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:48.134
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>So admin is really where we need to push
and try to understand how we can get some</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5166-1
00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:51.539
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>flexibility in in that capability that
makes sense. But yeah,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5161-0
00:30:51.045 --> 00:30:52.205
<v Rick Buczynski>Yep, I will stay.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5166-2
00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:54.175
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>B to B functionality via AP is should be
there.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5165-0
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:52.285
<v Doug Hatcher>Throw in.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5209-0
00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:59.850
<v Doug Hatcher>I was just gonna add that Nick and I was
talking the other day about admin</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5209-1
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:04.343
<v Doug Hatcher>extensibility and he mentioned something
that I thought was a really good idea</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5209-2
00:31:04.343 --> 00:31:08.778
<v Doug Hatcher>that if we could effectively treat the
admin like a composable kind of set of</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5209-3
00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:10.825
<v Doug Hatcher>components where we could build our.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5240-0
00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:13.113
<v Doug Hatcher>Own thing.
It would not only would kind of service</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5240-1
00:31:13.113 --> 00:31:16.613
<v Doug Hatcher>our use cases where we want to throw a
logo and kind of give a bespoke thing,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5240-2
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:20.157
<v Doug Hatcher>but it would also allow you guys just to
make a headless admin API and then we</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5240-3
00:31:20.157 --> 00:31:20.785
<v Doug Hatcher>just get like.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5251-0
00:31:21.255 --> 00:31:24.055
<v Doug Hatcher>React components or something to kind of
build something with it?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5254-0
00:31:23.165 --> 00:31:24.245
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5258-0
00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.015
<v Doug Hatcher>I thought it was really good.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5275-0
00:31:25.415 --> 00:31:28.733
<v Rick Buczynski>I think that's where the admin UI SDK is.
Is kind of to me.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5261-0
00:31:25.825 --> 00:31:25.985
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5275-1
00:31:28.733 --> 00:31:31.055
<v Rick Buczynski>It feels like a middle ground to that end.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5283-0
00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:36.135
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, yeah. OK, good. Super helpful.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5320-0
00:31:36.135 --> 00:31:40.465
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah, great feedback and we'll continue,
I think let us kinda digest this Rick.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5320-1
00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:44.741
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And then as you look at the data model
extensibility that you know beyond just</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5320-2
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:48.476
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>products and other pieces,
let's have another pull up maybe in three</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5320-3
00:31:48.476 --> 00:31:50.695
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>or four or five weeks and just kinda see.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5327-0
00:31:50.695 --> 00:31:52.455
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>And regroup if you're open to that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5331-0
00:31:52.895 --> 00:31:54.055
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5354-0
00:31:54.215 --> 00:31:58.362
<v Rick Buczynski>Last point I'll make is the business has
asked that we deliver this as a POV with</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5354-1
00:31:58.362 --> 00:32:01.295
<v Rick Buczynski>a statement of, you know,
should we stay or should we go?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5393-0
00:32:02.775 --> 00:32:05.887
<v Rick Buczynski>Right now and and I you know,
I just want to make sure that we have</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5393-1
00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:09.274
<v Rick Buczynski>your alignment on this as well.
Right now our our position is to stay the</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5393-2
00:32:09.274 --> 00:32:11.928
<v Rick Buczynski>course and in fact I if it's not in this
version Nishant,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5393-3
00:32:11.928 --> 00:32:13.575
<v Rick Buczynski>I might have actually added it that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5403-0
00:32:13.575 --> 00:32:15.135
<v Rick Buczynski>Why?
I asked about the order of the slides?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5410-0
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:17.315
<v Chanda Dani>It's there, Rick.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5411-0
00:32:17.475 --> 00:32:18.395
<v Chanda Dani>I have seen it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5415-0
00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:19.815
<v Rick Buczynski>OK, OK. OK, very good.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5446-0
00:32:19.315 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Chanda Dani>I have seen it and your recommendation is
to stay the course with AEM and pass and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5446-1
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.475
<v Chanda Dani>you have very nicely pointed out why you
are ruling out other options.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5460-0
00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:36.555
<v Chanda Dani>And I do not know if the team needs more
time, but I am in agreement.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5445-0
00:32:30.685 --> 00:32:32.165
<v Rick Buczynski>OK, OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5453-0
00:32:32.165 --> 00:32:32.605
<v Rick Buczynski>Very good.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5464-0
00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:37.925
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5475-0
00:32:38.405 --> 00:32:40.085
<v Rick Buczynski>Well, what I wanted to mention.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5471-0
00:32:39.255 --> 00:32:40.015
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I I think.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5483-0
00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:42.645
<v Chanda Dani>There are a few other things in the
documentation.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5507-0
00:32:42.645 --> 00:32:45.778
<v Chanda Dani>Minor stuff for which we have prepared a
list of points.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5507-1
00:32:45.778 --> 00:32:48.965
<v Chanda Dani>We'll send it to you like AEM as a
service does not come.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5504-0
00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:47.105
<v Rick Buczynski>Ah, OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5497-0
00:32:46.855 --> 00:32:47.095
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5529-0
00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:53.647
<v Chanda Dani>We have taken Universal editor from AM,
but it'll have the contractual limitation</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5529-1
00:32:53.647 --> 00:32:55.205
<v Chanda Dani>not to use outside commerce.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5543-0
00:32:55.805 --> 00:32:58.655
<v Chanda Dani>But yes,
it's not the full am as a service,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5538-0
00:32:56.715 --> 00:32:57.835
<v Rick Buczynski>Right, right.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5543-1
00:32:58.655 --> 00:32:59.885
<v Chanda Dani>not full AM assets.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5553-0
00:33:00.045 --> 00:33:03.125
<v Chanda Dani>So there are some minor corrections which
we'll send you.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5551-0
00:33:03.345 --> 00:33:03.745
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5554-0
00:33:03.745 --> 00:33:04.065

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5564-0
00:33:05.165 --> 00:33:07.285
<v Chanda Dani>Yeah, this is the recommendation slide,
yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5562-0
00:33:05.615 --> 00:33:06.175
<v Rick Buczynski>Jack, you got me up.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5567-0
00:33:09.635 --> 00:33:09.835
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5574-0
00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:12.205
<v Rick Buczynski>Jack. Sorry, did you wanna say something?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5571-0
00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:11.325
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5602-0

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5652-0
00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:30.915
<v Jack Lull>I wasn't sure if you'd seen that or not.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5647-0
00:33:29.575 --> 00:33:29.895
<v Rick Buczynski>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5653-0

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5686-0
00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:37.555
<v Jack Lull>And then just one last comment about the
the admin UI that was mentioned certainly</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5686-1
00:33:37.555 --> 00:33:44.275
<v Jack Lull>aspirationally we want to make it purely
API driven that is not in there right now.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5701-0
00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:48.481
<v Jack Lull>It's a long term thing,
so we're certainly in line with what you</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5690-0
00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:44.925
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5701-1
00:33:48.481 --> 00:33:49.115
<v Jack Lull>asked for.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5705-0
00:33:49.115 --> 00:33:51.035
<v Jack Lull>We're just timing will of course be.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5709-0
00:33:52.015 --> 00:33:52.375
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5715-0
00:33:52.015 --> 00:33:54.215
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, I get it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5711-0
00:33:52.505 --> 00:33:52.825
<v Jack Lull>What's important?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5716-0
00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:54.815
<v Rick Buczynski>I get it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5717-0
00:33:54.335 --> 00:33:54.695
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yes.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5754-0
00:33:54.975 --> 00:33:58.231
<v Rick Buczynski>And sorry,
I just wanted to add about because there</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5754-1
00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:03.303
<v Rick Buczynski>there's a there's an accident coming out
of this call for me that I want to make</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5754-2
00:34:03.303 --> 00:34:08.062
<v Rick Buczynski>sure that I that I get aligned Komatsu
mostly it has asked that we you know</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5754-3
00:34:08.062 --> 00:34:10.065
<v Rick Buczynski>share this POV with the rest of.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5768-0
00:34:10.055 --> 00:34:13.168
<v Rick Buczynski>The business,
but actually in a more summarized format</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5768-1
00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:16.055
<v Rick Buczynski>and also they've asked to have a
contingency that.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5784-0
00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:19.768
<v Rick Buczynski>If for any reason the business challenges
this and says, well,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5784-1
00:34:19.768 --> 00:34:21.895
<v Rick Buczynski>we feel that there's a different risk
factor.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5792-0
00:34:22.325 --> 00:34:24.125
<v Rick Buczynski>Involved. We want to go SAS anyway.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5794-0
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.085
<v Rick Buczynski>We want to force it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5811-0
00:34:25.285 --> 00:34:29.157
<v Rick Buczynski>We have to come prepared to kind of
evaluate that effort in terms of time and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5811-1
00:34:29.157 --> 00:34:29.405
<v Rick Buczynski>cost.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5818-0
00:34:29.405 --> 00:34:31.845
<v Rick Buczynski>So that's what we're going to bring to
the table.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5855-0
00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:37.142
<v Rick Buczynski>We are going to stay on a path course
with some risk mitigating activities to</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5855-1
00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:42.019
<v Rick Buczynski>make sure we're prepped for a long term
SaaS future and if we need to put it out</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5855-2
00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:45.390
<v Rick Buczynski>on the table,
we have basically a rough out of how much</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5855-3
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.775
<v Rick Buczynski>time it would take for.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5867-0
00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:50.325
<v Rick Buczynski>Us if we stopped right now and switch to
a SaaS based approach.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5873-0
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:52.725
<v Chanda Dani>Yep, Rick.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5870-0
00:34:51.305 --> 00:34:51.505
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5886-0
00:34:52.725 --> 00:34:56.047
<v Chanda Dani>Point #3,
just to reiterate so that we understood</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5886-1
00:34:56.047 --> 00:34:56.645
<v Chanda Dani>it right.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5897-0
00:34:56.645 --> 00:35:00.045
<v Chanda Dani>Why we rolled out Option 3 in your slide
here.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5909-0
00:35:00.045 --> 00:35:04.405
<v Chanda Dani>We did that because the current
implementation is with AEM, SIF, right?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5911-0
00:35:04.445 --> 00:35:05.485
<v Chanda Dani>And Martin's.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5910-0
00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:05.405
<v Rick Buczynski>That's correct.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5918-0
00:35:05.485 --> 00:35:07.925
<v Chanda Dani>Martin's recommendation was to stay that
route.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5926-0
00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:11.825
<v Rick Buczynski>Yes, that is correct. Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5922-0
00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:10.235
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5975-0
00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:17.744
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Rick, on on the recommendation,
I would just add,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5975-1
00:35:17.744 --> 00:35:21.920
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I I know it's in your talk track,
but just to be super clear,</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5975-2
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.512
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>I would add app builder like things that
can be done in App Builder should be done</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5975-3
00:35:27.512 --> 00:35:30.745
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>in App Builder even with the first one
just to.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/5988-0
00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:33.175
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Make sure you are future proofing what
you're building.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6000-0
00:35:33.295 --> 00:35:36.206
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yeah.
And the transition to staff would be</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6000-1
00:35:36.206 --> 00:35:40.335
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>relatively easier if you include that in
the recommendation.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6008-0
00:35:41.115 --> 00:35:42.635
<v Rick Buczynski>Yes, absolutely. Is there a?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6012-0
00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:44.615
<v Rick Buczynski>Is there a slide after this one nishant?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6027-0
00:35:44.885 --> 00:35:46.925
<v Rick Buczynski>Is there a slide?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6023-0
00:35:45.715 --> 00:35:46.595
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Let me see.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6029-0
00:35:45.825 --> 00:35:47.665
<v Chanda Dani>No, no, I don't recall, so.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6028-0
00:35:47.925 --> 00:35:48.525
<v Rick Buczynski>This one here.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6032-0
00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:48.845
<v Rick Buczynski>Yeah, yeah.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6040-0
00:35:48.845 --> 00:35:50.925
<v Rick Buczynski>So this, yeah,
this is where we start to elaborate on it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6053-0
00:35:50.925 --> 00:35:55.285
<v Rick Buczynski>So if you look here I I basically
selected the first option.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6046-0
00:35:51.665 --> 00:35:52.185
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6086-0
00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:58.879
<v Rick Buczynski>You'll see it in the blue bar at the top.
We just pulled it into the next slide and</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6062-0
00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:57.575
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Uh huh.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6086-1
00:35:58.879 --> 00:36:01.190
<v Rick Buczynski>we said OK,
given that there's still a risk with this</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6086-2
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.987
<v Rick Buczynski>approach,
what are some of our strategies</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6086-3
00:36:02.987 --> 00:36:03.885
<v Rick Buczynski>associated with that?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6104-0
00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:07.981
<v Rick Buczynski>So I I have it on a separate slide,
we just need to we just need more space</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6103-0
00:36:06.655 --> 00:36:08.295
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>OK. All right.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6104-1
00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:09.005
<v Rick Buczynski>to elaborate on it.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6114-0
00:36:12.205 --> 00:36:14.005
<v Daniela Murray>Rick, at this time,
I know we're over time.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6122-0
00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.376
<v Daniela Murray>What?
Is there anything further you need from</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6122-1
00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:16.685
<v Daniela Murray>Adobe?</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6159-0
00:36:17.445 --> 00:36:20.749
<v Rick Buczynski>That that feedback would be critical
because I want to make sure we're not</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6159-1
00:36:20.749 --> 00:36:23.480
<v Rick Buczynski>misrepresenting anything, you know,
based on this call alone.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6141-0
00:36:22.845 --> 00:36:22.965
<v CR AUS 110S01/Captain America VC (7)>Yep.</v>

ad853cfe-3ea6-40ce-838d-82fe57be6fe6/6159-2
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.916
<v Rick Buczynski>I think there were a couple points where
