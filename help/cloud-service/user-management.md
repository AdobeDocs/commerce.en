## Understanding roles

* **Users** - Users have Admin access to the Commerce Admin, and can manage users inside Commerce, but cannot manage product-level access. Users can also use credits to [create instances](./getting-started.md#create-an-instance) in the [!DNL Commerce Cloud Manager].


* [**Developers**](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-developers.html#Adddevelopers){target="_blank"} Developers have user permissions and are added to the Commerce instance as a developer user. This means they can use the [Admin UI SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/){target="_blank"}, [configure events](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/events/){target="_blank"}, and [create webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/){target="_blank"}.

* [**Admins**](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html){target="_blank"} - In addition to user permissions, admins can [Manage users, roles, and permissions for the product](#add-users-and-admins) in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].
