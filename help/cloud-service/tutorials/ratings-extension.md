# Ratings extension tutorial

This tutorial guides you through building a product ratings extension for [!DNL Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service] using [!DNL Adobe App Builder] and AI-assisted development tools.

Before you begin, complete the [prerequisites](./tutorial-prerequisites.md).

## Verify prerequisites

Verify that the following prerequisites are installed:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 22.x.x)
node --version

# Check npm version (should be 9.0.0 or higher)
npm --version

# Check Git installation
git --version

# Check Bash shell installation
bash --version
```

If any of the preceding commands do not return the expected results, refer to the [prerequisites](tutorial-prerequisites.md) for guidance.

## Extension development

This section guides you through developing a ratings extension for Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service using AI-assisted development tools.

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Cursor]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Cursor Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Tools & MCP]** and verify that the `commerce-extensibility` toolset is enabled without errors. If you see errors, toggle the toolset off and on.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When working with AI-assisted development tools, expect natural variations in the code and responses generated by the agent.
   >If you encounter any issues with your code, you can always ask the agent to help you debug it.

1. If you have any documentation added to Cursor's context, disable it:

   - Navigate to [!UICONTROL **Cursor**] > [!UICONTROL **Settings**] > [!UICONTROL **Cursor Settings**] > [!UICONTROL **Indexing & Docs**] and delete any documentation listed.

   ![Cursor indexing and docs settings with documentation list empty](../assets/disable-documentation.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Generate code for a product ratings extension: 
    - From the Cursor chat window, select [!UICONTROL **Agent**] mode.
    - Enter the following prompt:

   ```shell-session
   Implement an Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service extension to handle Product Ratings.

   Implement a REST API to handle GET ratings requests.
   
   GET requests will have to support the following query parameters:

   sku -> product SKU
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the agent requests to search the documentation, allow it.

1. Answer the agent's questions precisely to help it generate the best code.

   ![Cursor chat window in Agent mode with extension prompt entered](../assets/enter-prompt.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   ![AI agent asking clarifying questions about extension requirements](../assets/agent-questions.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Use the following example text to answer the agent's questions to set up randomized ratings data:

   ```shell-session
   Yes, this headless extension is for Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service storefront,
   but we do not need any authentication for the GET API because guest users should be able to use it on the storefront.

   This extension is called directly from the storefront, no async invocation, such as events or webhooks, is required.

   Start with just the GET API for now, we will implement other CRUD operations at a later time.
   
   We do not need a DB or storage mechanism right now, just return random ratings data between 1 and 5 and a ratings count between 1 and 1000.
   
   The API should only return the average rating for the product and the total number of ratings.
   We do not need to add tests right now.
   ```

   The agent creates a `requirements.md` file that serves as the source of truth for the implementation.

   ![Requirements.md file created by AI agent with implementation details](../assets/requirements-file.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Review the `requirements.md` file and verify the plan. 

   If everything looks correct, instruct the agent to move to **Phase 2 - Architecture Planning**.
1. Review the architecture plan.
1. Instruct the agent to proceed with code generation.

   The agent generates the necessary code and provides a detailed summary with your next steps.

   ![AI agent providing next steps for testing and deployment](../assets/next-steps.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Local testing

1. Ask the agent to help you test the code locally.

   ```shell-session
   Test the ratings API locally on a dev server using cURL.
   ```

1. Follow the agent's instructions and confirm that the API is working locally.

   ![Terminal showing successful local API test results with cURL](../assets/local-testing-1.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Deploy the extension

1. After verifying the generated code, deploy the extension using the following prompt:

   ```shell-session
   Deploy the ratings API.
   ```

   The agent performs a pre-deployment readiness assessment before deploying.

   ![AI agent pre-deployment readiness assessment checklist](../assets/pre-deployment-assessment.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. When you are confident with the assessment results, instruct the agent to proceed with deployment.
   
    The agent uses the MCP toolkit to verify, build, and deploy automatically.

### Post deployment

You can test the API before integrating it into the storefront. The agent should provide the location of the new action and a testing strategy.

![AI agent testing strategy with deployed action URL and test commands](../assets/testing-strategy.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

You can also test the API manually using cURL in a terminal:

```bash
curl -s "https://<your-site>.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/ratings/ratings?sku=TEST-SKU-123"
```

![Terminal showing successful cURL test of deployed ratings API](../assets/curl-test.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Integrate with Edge Delivery Services

To integrate the ratings API with an [!DNL Adobe Commerce] storefront powered by [!DNL Edge Delivery Services], ask the agent to create a service contract with requirements for the ratings API:

```shell-session
Create a service contract for the ratings api that I can pass on to the storefront agent. Name it RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md
```

![AI agent creating service contract file for storefront integration](../assets/create-contract.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

![Ratings API contract markdown file with endpoint and response details](../assets/contract.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}
<!-- 
Return to the terminal and run the following command in the `extension` folder to copy the file to the `storefront` folder:

```bash
cp RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md ../storefront
``` -->

### Next steps

Now that you have the ratings API contract, you can begin building the storefront (frontend) portion of the ratings extension.

<!-- 
## Connect to the storefront

This section teaches you how to implement real storefront features and communicate effectively with AI agents when working with [!DNL Adobe Commerce] dropins and [!DNL Edge Delivery Services].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The prompts provided are starting points. Although you can use them without modification, consider having a natural conversation with the agent.
>
>When working with AI-assisted development tools, there are always natural variations in the code and responses generated by the agent.
>
>If you encounter any issues with your code, ask the agent to help you debug it.

### Ratings stars and review count implementation

1. Navigate to the `storefront` folder:

   ```bash
   cd storefront
   ```

1. Open the storefront folder in a new Cursor window.

    Alternatively, if you have the [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/shell#installing-cli-commands) installed, open the window by using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cursor .
   ```

1. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

1. In a browser, navigate to the Apparel page:

   ```shell-session
   http://localhost:3000/apparel
   ```

1. Observe the boilerplate storefront UI layout and note the lack of visual product ratings.

1. Use the following prompt with your agent:

   ```shell-session
   Implement product ratings in the storefront.

   Add a 5-star rating display with a review count underneath each product name on the product list page, product details page, and product recommendations.

   Use the dropin slot system where available.

   Use @RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md to understand how to use the ratings API.
   ```

1. Observe the changes in the codebase, and watch the Apparel page for updates.

   You should see the following changes in your development environment and browser:

   * A product rating "component" is automatically created.
   * The component is integrated into product-details, product-list-page, and product-recommendations blocks using [dropin slots](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/dropins/customize/slots).
   * Stars display with proper fill proportions based on mock rating values.

### Add rating distribution modal

The following steps show how the agent handles complex UI features with visual references.

1. **Before starting:** Save the following mock image and paste it into the chat with your storefront agent.

   ![Rating Distribution Mockup](../assets/rating-distribution-mockup.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Follow these steps to create the ratings distribution modal using the reference image as a guide:

   * Update the API to return additional data representing the ratings distribution.
   * Update the API Contract.
   * Update the contact in the storefront codebase.
   * Ask the storefront agent to use the reference image and updated API Contract to add the ratings distribution to the PDP page.

1. Observe the following changes in the codebase, and watch the Apparel page for updates:

   * How the agent interprets the visual mockup
   * Whether it uses appropriate HTML structure for accessibility
   * How it handles the positioning and interaction states

#### Troubleshooting

* If the modal does not appear, check the browser console for errors.
* If positioning is off, ask the agent to fix it using the following format:

   ```shell-session
   adjust the modal position to be...
   ```
