# Ratings extension tutorial (Beta)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AI tooling used in this tutorial is currently in Beta and could include bugs or other issues.

This tutorial guides you through building a product ratings extension for [!DNL Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service] using [!DNL Adobe App Builder] and AI-assisted development tools.

Before you begin, complete the [prerequisites](ratings-prerequisites.md).

## Verify prerequisites

Verify the following prerequisites are installed:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 22.x.x)
node --version

# Check npm version (should be 9.0.0 or higher)
npm --version

# Check Git installation
git --version

# Check Bash shell installation
bash --version
```

If any of the preceding commands do not return the expected results, refer to the [prerequisites](tutorial-prerequisites.md) page.

## Extension development

This section guides you through the process of developing a ratings extension for Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service using AI-assisted development tools.

1. At this point, all [!DNL Cursor] rules are installed in the `.cursor/rules` folder. You can find MCP tools in the **MCP Settings** in [!DNL Cursor]. Verify that the `commerce-extensibility` toolset is enabled without errors. If you see errors, toggle the toolset off and on.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When working with AI-assisted development tools, there will be natural variations in the code and responses generated by the agent.
   >If you encounter any issues with your code, you can always ask the agent to help you debug it.

1. If you have any documentation added to Cursor's context, you will need to disable it. Navigate to [!UICONTROL **Cursor**] > [!UICONTROL **Settings**] > [!UICONTROL **Cursor Settings**] > [!UICONTROL **Indexing & Docs**] and delete any documentation listed.

   ![Disable documentation](./assets/disable-documentation.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Generate code for a product ratings extension by opening the chat window in Cursor. Select the **Agent** mode and enter the following prompt:

   ```text
   Implement an Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service extension to handle Product Ratings.

   Implement a REST API to handle GET ratings requests.
   
   GET requests will have to support the following query parameters:

   sku -> product SKU
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the agent requests to search the documentation, allow it.

   ![Enter prompt in Cursor](./assets/enter-prompt.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. The agent researches the requirements and asks clarifying questions. Answer the agent's questions precisely to help it generate the best code.

   ![Agent asks clarifying questions](./assets/agent-questions.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Use the following response to answer the agent's questions and set up randomized ratings data:

   ```text
   Yes, this headless extension is for Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service storefront,
   but we do not need any authentication for the GET API because guest users should be able to use it on the storefront.

   This extension will be called directly from the storefront, no async invocation, such as events or webhooks, is required.

   Start with just the GET API for now, we will implement other CRUD operations at a later time.
   
   We do not need a DB or storage mechanism right now, just return random ratings data between 1 and 5 and a ratings count between 1 and 1000.
   
   The API should only return the average rating for the product and the total number of ratings.
   We do not need to add tests right now.
   ```

   The agent creates a `requirements.md` file that serves as the source of truth for the implementation.

   ![Requirements file created](./assets/requirements-file.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Review the `requirements.md` file and verify the plan. If everything looks correct, instruct the agent to move to **Phase 2 - Architecture Planning**.
1. Review the architecture plan.
1. Instruct the agent to proceed with code generation. The agent generates the necessary code and provides a detailed summary with your next steps.

   ![Architecture planning](./assets/architecture-planning.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   ![Code generation summary](./assets/code-generation-summary.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   ![Next steps](./assets/next-steps.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Local testing

1. Ask the agent to help you test the code locally.

   ```text
   Test the ratings API locally on a dev server using cURL.
   ```

1. Follow the agent's instructions and confirm that the API is working locally.

   ![Local testing](./assets/local-testing.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   ![Local testing results](./assets/local-testing-1.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Deploy the extension

1. After verifying the generated code, deploy the extension using the following prompt:

   ```text
   Deploy the ratings API.
   ```

   The agent performs a pre-deployment readiness assessment before deploying.

   ![Pre-deployment assessment](./assets/pre-deployment-assessment.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. When you are confident with the assessment results, instruct the agent to proceed with deployment. The agent uses the MCP toolkit to verify, build, and deploy automatically.

   ![Deployment](./assets/deployment-process.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Post deployment

You can test the API before integrating it into the storefront. The agent should provide the location of the new action and a testing strategy.

![Testing strategy](./assets/testing-strategy.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

You can also test the API manually using cURL in a terminal:

```bash
curl -s "https://<your-site>.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/ratings/ratings?sku=TEST-SKU-123"
```

![cURL test](./assets/curl-test.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

### Integrate with Edge Delivery Services

To integrate the ratings API with an [!DNL Adobe Commerce] storefront powered by [!DNL Edge Delivery Services], ask the agent to create a service contract with requirements for the ratings API:

```text
Create a service contract for the ratings api that I can pass on to the storefront agent. Name it RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md
```

![Service contract](./assets/create-contract.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

![Service contract details](./assets/contract.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

Return to the terminal and run the following command in the `extension` folder to copy the file to the `storefront` folder:

```bash
cp RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md ../storefront
```

## Connect to the storefront

In this section, you will implement real storefront features, learning how to communicate effectively with AI agents when working with [!DNL Adobe Commerce] dropins and [!DNL Edge Delivery Services].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The prompts provided are starting points and while you can use them without modification, you should consider having a natural conversation with the agent.
>
>When working with AI-assisted development tools, there are always natural variations in the code and responses generated by the agent.
>
>If you encounter any issues with your code, ask the agent to help you debug it.

### Ratings stars and review count implementation

1. Navigate to the `storefront` folder:

   ```bash
   cd storefront
   ```

1. Open the storefront folder in a new Cursor window. If you have the [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/shell#installing-cli-commands) installed, you can alternatively use the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cursor .
   ```

1. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

1. In a browser, navigate to the Apparel page:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/apparel
   ```

1. Observe the boilerplate storefront UI layout and note the lack of visual product ratings.

1. Use the following prompt with your agent:

   ```text
   Implement product ratings in the storefront.

   Add a 5-star rating display with a review count underneath each product name on the product list page, product details page, and product recommendations.

   Use the dropin slot system where available.

   Use @RATINGS_API_CONTRACT.md to understand how to use the ratings API.
   ```

1. Observe the changes in the codebase, and watch the Apparel page for updates. You should see the following changes in your development environment and browser:

   * A product rating "component" is automatically created.
   * The component is integrated into product-details, product-list-page, and product-recommendations blocks using [dropin slots](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/dropins/customize/slots).
   * Stars display with proper fill proportions based on mock rating values.

### Add rating distribution modal

The following steps show how the agent handles complex UI features with visual references.

1. **Before starting:** Save the following mock image and paste it into the chat with your storefront agent.

   ![Rating Distribution Mockup](./assets/rating-distribution-mockup.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Use the following steps to guide you through creating the ratings distribution modal based on the reference image:

   * Update the API to return additional data representing the ratings distribution.
   * Update the API Contract.
   * Update the contact in the storefront codebase.
   * Ask the storefront agent to use the reference image and updated API Contract to add the ratings distribution to the PDP page.

1. Observe the following changes in the codebase, and watch the Apparel page for updates:

   * How the agent interprets the visual mockup
   * Whether it uses appropriate HTML structure for accessibility
   * How it handles the positioning and interaction states

#### Troubleshooting
* If the modal does not appear, check the browser console for errors.
* If positioning is off, you can ask the agent to:

   ```text
   adjust the modal position to be...
   ```
