# Adobe Commerce product solutions

Adobe offers several solutions to meet the requirements of your ecommerce business. The Adobe Commerce documentation on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce) and the [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs/) provides customers with self-service resources that support all solutions. However, navigating such a large volume of content can be challenging.

## Badges

Badges are designed to help you identify whether the Commerce documentation that you find is relevant to the Commerce product solutions that you use.

### Definitions

The following table defines the badges that display across Adobe Commerce documentation.

| Badge type | Solution | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|
| [!BADGE SaaS]{type=Positive tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce Optimizer projects (Adobe-managed SaaS infrastructure)."} | [Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service](../cloud-service/overview.md)<br/>[Adobe Commerce Optimizer](../optimizer/overview.md) | This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce Optimizer projects. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution where Adobe is responsible for most operational aspects—such as continuous updates, security monitoring, and scalability—so that customers can focus on commerce rather than infrastructure. |
| [!BADGE PaaS]{type=Informative tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce on Cloud projects (Adobe-managed PaaS infrastructure)."} | [Adobe Commerce on Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-on-cloud/user-guide/overview) | This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in Adobe Commerce on Cloud projects. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution that provides all of Adobe Commerce's core features in a pre‑provisioned cloud environment. |
| [!BADGE On-premises]{type=Neutral tooltip="Applies to on-premises Adobe Commerce projects (customer-managed hosting)."} | [Adobe Commerce on-premises](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/overview) | This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in Adobe Commerce on-premises projects. This includes projects based on the Magento Open Source code base, even though not all Adobe Commerce features are available. Features exclusive to Adobe Commerce are marked accordingly. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>The badges described here apply specifically to Adobe Commerce documentation. They do not represent how badges may be used in the documentation for other Adobe Experience Cloud products.
