# Adobe Commerce product editions

Adobe offers several solutions to fit the requirements of your ecommerce business. The Adobe Commerce documentation is designed to accommodate customers using all solutions, with notations for features and functionality that are either exclusive to a solution or available across solutions.

>[!NOTE]
>
>- If only one badge displays above the page title, the content applies to that edition only. If multiple badges display above the page title, the content applies to all indicated editions.
>
>- Inline badges can be useful if the page contains a mix of content applicable to multiple solutions. We should probably use that sparingly though to reduce visual clutter/fatigue.

## SaaS

[!BADGE SaaS]{type=Positive tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce Optimizer projects (Adobe-managed SaaS infrastructure)."}

This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in [Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service](../cloud-service/overview.md) and [Adobe Commerce Optimizer](../optimizer/overview.md) projects. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution where Adobe is responsible for most operational aspects—such as continuous updates, security monitoring, and scalability—so that customers can focus on commerce rather than infrastructure.

## PaaS

[!BADGE PaaS]{type=Informative tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce on Cloud projects (Adobe-managed PaaS infrastructure)."}

This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in [Adobe Commerce on Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-on-cloud/user-guide/overview) projects. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution that provides all of Adobe Commerce's core features in a pre‑provisioned cloud environment.

## On-premises

[!BADGE On-premises]{type=Neutral tooltip="Applies to on-premises Adobe Commerce projects (customer-managed hosting)."}

This badge represents documentation related to features and functionality available in [Adobe Commerce on-premises](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/overview) projects. This includes projects based on the Magento Open Source code base, even though not all Adobe Commerce features are available.

Features exclusive to Adobe Commerce are marked accordingly.
