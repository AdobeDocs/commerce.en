# Adobe Commerce product solutions

Adobe offers several solutions to meet the requirements of your ecommerce business. The Adobe Commerce documentation on [Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce) and the [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs/) provides customers with self-service resources that support all solutions. However, navigating such a large volume of content can be challenging without guidance.

## Badges

Badges are designed to help you identify whether the Commerce documentation that you find through conventional site navigation or organic search is relevant to the Commerce product solutions that you use.

### Definitions

The following table defines the badges that display across Adobe Commerce documentation.

| Badge type | Solution | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|
| [!BADGE SaaS only]{type=Positive tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce Optimizer projects only (Adobe-managed SaaS infrastructure)."} | [Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service](../cloud-service/overview.md)<br/>[Adobe Commerce Optimizer](../optimizer/overview.md) | This badge represents documentation related Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce Optimizer projects only. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution where Adobe is responsible for most operational aspects—such as continuous updates, security monitoring, and scalability—so that customers can focus on commerce rather than infrastructure. |
| [!BADGE PaaS only]{type=Informative tooltip="Applies to Adobe Commerce on Cloud projects only (Adobe-managed PaaS infrastructure)."} | [Adobe Commerce on Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-on-cloud/user-guide/overview) | This badge represents documentation related to Adobe Commerce on Cloud projects only. These projects are hosted on a cloud‑native, fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution that provides all of Adobe Commerce's core features in a pre‑provisioned cloud environment. |
| [!BADGE On-premises only]{type=Neutral tooltip="Applies to on-premises Adobe Commerce projects (customer-managed hosting)."} | [Adobe Commerce on-premises](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/overview) | This badge represents documentation related to Adobe Commerce on-premises projects only. This includes projects based on the Magento Open Source code base, even though not all Adobe Commerce features are available. Features exclusive to Adobe Commerce are marked accordingly. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>The badges described here apply specifically to Adobe Commerce documentation. They do not represent how badges may be used in the documentation for other Adobe Experience Cloud products.

### Rules

Use the following rules to understand what content applies to each Adobe Commerce solution:

- **Page-level**: Display at the top of a page (above the page title). Page-level badges indicate that _all_ content on the page applies to the specified solution only.

- **Section-level**: Display immediately below all other headings on a page (except page title). Section-level badges indicate that the content in that section applies to the specified solution only.

- **Inline**: Display within all non-heading page elements, such as tables, paragraphs, and lists. Inline badges indicate that the content in that element applies to the specified solution only.

![info](../cloud-service/assets/Smock_InfoOutline_18_N.svg) The page- and section-level badge types defined here are intended to be mutually exclusive. That means you won't see multiple page- and section-level badges. However, multiple inline badges are possible.
