# AEM Assets Integration for Commerce

The demand for personalized content is rapidly increasing while marketing budgets are under pressure. Retailers and brands are struggling to keep pace with the growing need for variations in product imagery, driven by regional, seasonal, and segment-specific requirements.

Consider a retailer with 1,000 products. Even before factoring in attribute variations, the number of required digital assets expands significantly when considering different regions, customer segments, and personalization efforts. This can lead to an overwhelming number of asset variations, reaching into the millions.

The AEM Assets Integration addresses this challenge by automating asset management workflows. The integration ensures that digital assets, such as product images and marketing content, are dynamically linked to the appropriate merchandising entities, including products and categories in Adobe Commerce, based on SKU or other key attributes. This process streamlines operations and enhances efficiency by enabling:

* **Seamless Installation and Configuration**â€“ Merchandising teams and developers can quickly set up the integration using familiar Adobe tools and workflows.

* **Dynamic Asset Updates**-Product images and marketing assets automatically reflect the latest changes in AEM Assets, keeping storefronts accurate and relevant.

* **Streamlined Catalog Management**-Automates asset refresh and cleanup, minimizing manual effort and ensuring a consistent, well-maintained product catalog.
