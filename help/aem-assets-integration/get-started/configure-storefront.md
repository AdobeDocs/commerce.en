# Configure your Storefront

The AEM Assets integration displays product images managed in AEM Assets instead of traditional Commerce-hosted images. The integration delivers enhanced image management capabilities: advanced optimization, cropping, and delivery through Adobe’s Content Delivery Network (CDN). 

To use AEM Assets with the Commerce Storefront powered by Edge Delivery Services, complete the storefront configuration described in the [EDS AEM Assets configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/setup/configuration/aem-assets-configuration/) topic.
